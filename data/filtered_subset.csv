SPRING,"Spring, the sweet Spring, is the year's pleasant king;
Then blooms each thing, then maids dance in a ring,
Cold doth not sting, the pretty birds do sing,
Cuckoo, jug-jug, pu-we, to-witta-woo!

The palm and may make country houses gay,
Lambs frisk and play, the shepherds pipe all day,
And we hear aye birds tune their merry lay,
Cuckoo, jug-jug, pu-we, to-witta-woo!

The fields breathe sweet, the daisies kiss our feet,
Young lovers meet, old wives a-sunning sit,
In every street these tunes our ears do greet,
Cuckoo, jug-jug, pu-we, to-witta-woo!
  Spring, the sweet Spring!",T. NASH.,Golden Treasury,15.0,37.6,
TIME AND LOVE,"When I have seen by Time's fell hand defaced
The rich proud cost of out-worn buried age;
When sometime lofty towers I see down-razed,
And brass eternal slave to mortal rage.

When I have seen the hungry ocean gain
Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,
And the firm soil win of the watery main,
Increasing store with loss, and loss with store.

When I have seen such interchange of state,
Or state itself confounded to decay,
Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate—
That Time will come and take my Love away.

—This thought is as a death, which cannot choose
But weep to have that which it fears to lose.",W. SHAKESPEARE.,Golden Treasury,17.0,34.529411764705884,
,"Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,
But sad mortality o'ersways their power,
How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,
Whose action is no stronger than a flower?

O how shall summer's honey breath hold out,
Against the wreckful siege of battering days,
When rocks impregnable are not so stout,
Nor gates of steel so strong but time decays?

O fearful meditation, where, alack!
Shall Time's best jewel from Time's chest lie hid?
Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back,
Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?

O! none, unless this miracle have might,
That in black ink my love may still shine bright.",W. SHAKESPEARE.,Golden Treasury,17.0,36.11764705882353,
,"Under the greenwood tree
Who loves to lie with me,
And tune his merry note
Unto the sweet bird's throat—
Come hither, come hither, come hither!
  Here shall we see
  No enemy
But winter and rough weather.

Who doth ambition shun
And loves to live i' the sun,
Seeking the food he eats
And pleased with what he gets—
Come hither, come hither, come hither!
  Here shall he see
  No enemy
But winter and rough weather.",W. SHAKESPEARE.,Golden Treasury,17.0,23.47058823529412,
,"It was a lover and his lass
With a hey, and a ho, and a hey-nonino!
That o'er the green cornfield did pass,
In the spring time, the only pretty ring time,
When birds do sing hey ding a ding:
Sweet lovers love the Spring.
Between the acres of the rye
These pretty country folks would lie:
This carol they began that hour,
How that life was but a flower:
And therefore take the present time
With a hey, and a ho, and a hey-nonino!
For love is crownéd with the prime
In spring time, the only pretty ring time,
When birds do sing, hey ding a ding;
Sweet lovers love the Spring.",W. SHAKESPEARE.,Golden Treasury,16.0,34.9375,
ABSENCE,"Being your slave what should I do but tend
Upon the hours and times of your desire?
I have no precious time at all to spend,
Nor services to do, till you require:

Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour
Whilst I, my sovereign, watch the clock for you,
Nor think the bitterness of absence sour
When you have bid your servant once adieu:

Nor dare I question with my jealous thought
Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,
But like a sad slave, stay and think of nought
Save where you are, how happy you make those;—

So true a fool is love, that in your will,
Though you do any thing, he thinks no ill.",W. SHAKESPEARE.,Golden Treasury,17.0,34.94117647058823,
,"How like a winter hath my absence been
From Thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!
What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen,
What old December's bareness everywhere!

And yet this time removed was summer's time:
The teeming autumn, big with rich increase,
Bearing the wanton burden of the prime
Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease:

Yet this abundant issue seem'd to me
But hope of orphans, and unfather'd fruit;
For summer and his pleasures wait on thee,
And, thou away, the very birds are mute;

Or if they sing, 'tis with so dull a cheer,
That leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near.",W. SHAKESPEARE.,Golden Treasury,17.0,35.05882352941177,
A CONSOLATION,"When in disgrace with Fortune and men's eyes
I all alone beweep my outcast state,
And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,
And look upon myself, and curse my fate;

Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,
Featured like him, like him with friends possest,
Desiring this man's art, and that man's scope,
With what I most enjoy contented least;

Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising,
Haply I think on Thee—and then my state,
Like to the lark at break of day arising
From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate;

For thy sweet love remember'd, such wealth brings
That then I scorn to change my state with kings.",W. SHAKESPEARE.,Golden Treasury,17.0,36.1764705882353,
THE UNCHANGEABLE,"O never say that I was false of heart,
Though absence seem'd my flame to qualify:
As easy might I from my self depart
As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie;

That is my home of love, if I have ranged,
Like him that travels, I return again,
Just to the time, not with the time exchanged,
So that myself bring water for my stain.

Never believe, though in my nature reign'd
All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,
That it could so preposterously be stain'd
To leave for nothing all thy sum of good:

For nothing this wide universe I call,
Save thou, my rose, in it thou art my all.",W. SHAKESPEARE.,Golden Treasury,17.0,34.0,
,"To me, fair Friend, you never can be old,
For as you were when first your eye I eyed
Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold
Have from the forests shook three summers' pride;

Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn'd,
In process of the seasons have I seen,
Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burn'd,
Since first I saw you fresh which yet are green.

Ah! yet doth beauty, like a dial hand,
Steal from his figure, and no pace perceived;
So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,
Hath motion, and mine eye may be deceived:

For fear of which, hear this, thou age unbred,—
Ere you were born, was beauty's summer dead.",W. SHAKESPEARE.,Golden Treasury,17.0,37.0,
TO HIS LOVE,"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer's lease hath all too short a date:

Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd,
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature's changing course, untrimm'd.

But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest;
Nor shall death brag thou wanderest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to time thou growest.

So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.",W. SHAKESPEARE.,Golden Treasury,17.0,35.94117647058823,
TO HIS LOVE,"When in the chronicle of wasted time
I see descriptions of the fairest wights,
And beauty making beautiful old rhyme
In praise of ladies dead, and lovely knights;

Then in the blazon of sweet beauty's best
Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,
I see their antique pen would have exprest
Ev'n such a beauty as you master now.

So all their praises are but prophecies
Of this our time, all, you prefiguring;
And for they look'd but with divining eyes,
They had not skill enough your worth to sing:

For we, which now behold these present days,
Have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.",W. SHAKESPEARE.,Golden Treasury,17.0,34.11764705882353,
TO AURORA,"O if thou knew'st how thou thyself does harm,
And dost prejudge thy bliss, and spoil thy rest;
Then thou would'st melt the ice out of thy breast
And thy relenting heart would kindly warm.

O if thy pride did not our joys controul,
What world of loving wonders should'st thou see!
For if I saw thee once transform'd in me,
Then in thy bosom I would pour my soul;

Then all my thoughts should in thy visage shine,
And if that aught mischanced thou should'st not moan
Nor bear the burthen of thy griefs alone;
No, I would have my share in what were thine:

And whilst we thus should make our sorrows one,
This happy harmony would make them none.","W. ALEXANDER, EARL OF STERLINE.",Golden Treasury,17.0,36.88235294117647,
TRUE LOVE,"Let me not to the marriage of true minds
Admit impediments. Love is not love
Which alters when it alteration finds,
Or bends with the remover to remove:—

O no! it is an ever-fixéd mark
That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
It is the star to every wandering bark
Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.

Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
Within his bending sickle's compass come;
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
But bears it out ev'n to the edge of doom:—

If this be error and upon me proved,
I never writ, nor no man ever loved.",W. SHAKESPEARE.,Golden Treasury,17.0,33.411764705882355,
A DITTY,"My true love hath my heart, and I have his,
By just exchange one to the other given:
I hold his dear, and mine he cannot miss,
There never was a better bargain driven:
My true love hath my heart, and I have his.

His heart in me keeps him and me in one,
My heart in him his thoughts and senses guides:
He loves my heart, for once it was his own,
I cherish his because in me it bides:
My true-love hath my heart, and I have his.",SIR P. SIDNEY.,Golden Treasury,11.0,38.0,
LOVE'S OMNIPRESENCE,"Were I as base as is the lowly plain,
And you, my Love, as high as heaven above,
Yet should the thoughts of me your humble swain
Ascend to heaven, in honour of my Love.

Were I as high as heaven above the plain,
And you, my Love, as humble and as low
As are the deepest bottoms of the main,
Whereso'er you were, with you my love should go.

Were you the earth, dear Love, and I the skies,
My love should shine on you like to the sun,
And look upon you with ten thousand eyes
Till heaven wax'd blind, and till the world were done.

Whereso'er I am, below, or else above you,
Whereso'er you are, my heart shall truly love you.",J. SYLVESTER.,Golden Treasury,17.0,35.8235294117647,
CARPE DIEM,"O Mistress mine, where are you roaming?
O, stay and hear! your true-love's coming
That can sing both high and low;
Trip no further, pretty sweeting,
Journeys end in lovers' meeting—
Every wise man's son doth know.

What is love? 'tis not hereafter;
Present mirth hath present laughter;
What's to come is still unsure:
In delay there lies no plenty,—
Then come kiss me, Sweet-and-twenty,
Youth's a stuff will not endure.",W. SHAKESPEARE.,Golden Treasury,13.0,31.384615384615383,
,"That time of year thou may'st in me behold
When yellow leaves, or none, or few do hang
Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,
Bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.

In me thou seest the twilight of such day
As after sunset fadeth in the west,
Which by and by black night doth take away,
Death's second self, that seals up all in rest.

In me thou seest the glowing of such fire,
That on the ashes of his youth doth lie
As the deathbed whereon it must expire,
Consumed with that which it was nourish'd by.

—This thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong,
To love that well which thou must leave ere long.",W. SHAKESPEARE.,Golden Treasury,17.0,36.52941176470589,
REMEMBRANCE,"When to the sessions of sweet silent thought
I summon up remembrance of things past,
I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,
And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste

Then can I drown an eye, unused to flow,
For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,
And weep afresh love's long-since-cancell'd woe,
And moan the expense of many a vanish'd sight.

Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,
And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er
The sad account of fore-bemoanéd moan,
Which I new pay as if not paid before:

—But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,
All losses are restored, and sorrows end.",W. SHAKESPEARE.,Golden Treasury,17.0,35.23529411764706,
REVOLUTIONS,"Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore
So do our minutes hasten to their end;
Each changing place with that which goes before,
In sequent toil all forwards do contend.

Nativity once in the main of light
Crawls to maturity, wherewith being crown'd,
Crooked eclipses 'gainst his glory fight,
And Time that gave, doth now his gift confound.

Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth,
And delves the parallels in beauty's brow;
Feeds on the rarities of nature's truth,
And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow.

And yet, to times in hope, my verse shall stand
Praising Thy worth, despite his cruel hand.",W. SHAKESPEARE.,Golden Treasury,17.0,35.47058823529412,
,"Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,
And like enough thou know'st thy estimate:
The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing,
My bonds in thee are all determinate.

For how do I hold thee but by thy granting?
And for that riches where is my deserving?
The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,
And so my patent back again is swerving.

Thyself thou gav'st, thy own worth then not knowing,
Or me, to whom thou gav'st it, else mistaking;
So thy great gift, upon misprision growing,
Comes home again, on better judgement making.

Thus have I had thee as a dream doth flatter;
In sleep, a king; but waking, no such matter.",W. SHAKESPEARE.,Golden Treasury,17.0,36.35294117647059,
THE LIFE WITHOUT PASSION,"They that have power to hurt, and will do none,
That do not do the thing they most do show,
Who, moving others, are themselves as stone,
Unmovéd, cold, and to temptation slow,—

They rightly do inherit Heaven's graces,
And husband nature's riches from expense;
They are the lords and owners of their faces,
Others, but stewards of their excellence.

The summer's flower is to the summer sweet,
Though to itself it only live and die;
But if that flower with base infection meet,
The basest weed outbraves his dignity:

For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds;
Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds.",W. SHAKESPEARE.,Golden Treasury,17.0,35.1764705882353,
,"Care-charmer Sleep, son of the sable Night,
Brother to Death, in silent darkness born,
Relieve my anguish, and restore the light;
With dark forgetting of my care return.

And let the day be time enough to mourn
The shipwreck of my ill adventured youth:
Let waking eyes suffice to wail their scorn,
Without the torment of the night's untruth.

Cease, dreams, the images of day-desires,
To model forth the passions of the morrow;
Never let rising Sun approve you liars
To add more grief to aggravate my sorrow:

Still let me sleep, embracing clouds in vain,
And never wake to feel the day's disdain.",S. DANIEL,Golden Treasury,17.0,34.23529411764706,
MADRIGAL,"Take O take those lips away
That so sweetly were forsworn,
And those eyes, the break of day,
Lights that do mislead the morn:
But my kisses bring again,
          Bring again—
Seals of love, but seal'd in vain,
          Seal'd in vain!",W. SHAKESPEARE.,Golden Treasury,8.0,28.75,
LOVE'S FAREWELL,"Since there's no help, come let us kiss and part,—
Nay, I have done, you get no more of me;
And I am glad, yea glad with all my heart,
That thus so cleanly I myself can free;

Shake hands for ever, cancel all our vows,
And when we meet at any time again,
Be it not seen in either of our brows
That we one jot of former love retain.

Now at the last gasp of love's latest breath,
When his pulse failing, passion speechless lies,
When faith is kneeling by his bed of death,
And innocence is closing up his eyes,

—Now if thou wouldst, when all have given him over,
From death to life thou might'st him yet recover!",M. DRAYTON.,Golden Treasury,17.0,35.11764705882353,
TO HIS LUTE,"My lute, be as thou wert when thou did'st grow
With thy green mother in some shady grove,
When immelodious winds but made thee move,
And birds their ramage did on thee bestow.

Since that dear Voice which did thy sounds approve,
Which wont in such harmonious strains to flow,
Is reft from Earth to tune those spheres above,
What art thou but a harbinger of woe?

Thy pleasing notes be pleasing notes no more,
But orphan's wailings to the fainting ear;
Each stroke a sigh, each sound draws forth a tear;
For which be silent as in woods before:

Or if that any hand to touch thee deign,
Like widow'd turtle still her loss complain.",W. DRUMMOND.,Golden Treasury,17.0,36.11764705882353,
BLIND LOVE,"O me! what eyes hath love put in my head
Which have no correspondence with true sight:
Or if they have, where is my judgment fled
That censures falsely what they see aright?

If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,
What means the world to say it is not so?
If it be not, then love doth well denote,
Love's eye is not so true as all men's: No,

How can it? O how can love's eye be true,
That is so vex'd with watching and with tears?
No marvel then though I mistake my view:
The sun itself sees not till heaven clears.

O cunning Love! with tears thou keep'st me blind,
Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find!",W. SHAKESPEARE.,Golden Treasury,17.0,35.76470588235294,
MADRIGAL,"My thoughts hold mortal strife;

I am slain by a fair cruel maid.
My shroud of white, stuck all with yew,

My part of death no one so true
  Did share it.

Not a flower, not a flower sweet,
On my black coffin let there be strown;
Not a friend, not a friend greet

A thousand thousand sighs to save,

Sad true lover never find my grave,

A SEA DIRGE,"Full fathom five thy father lies:
Of his bones are coral made;

His justice which proud rebels doth not spare,
In every page, no period of the same.

But silly we, like foolish children, rest
Well pleased with colour'd vellum, leaves of gold,
Fair dangling ribbands, leaving what is best,

Yet you, proud monarchs, must obey
And mingle with forgotten ashes, when
Death calls ye to the crowd of common men.

Devouring Famine, Plague, and War,
Each able to undo mankind,
Death's servile emissaries are;
Nor to these alone confined,
  He hath at will
More quaint and subtle ways to kill;

Shall have the cunning skill to break a heart.",J. SHIRLEY.,Golden Treasury,17.0,30.47058823529412,
WHEN THE ASSAULT WAS INTENDED TO THE CITY,"Captain, or Colonel, or Knight in arms,

If deed of honour did thee ever please;
Guard them, and him within protect from harms.

He can requite thee; for he knows the charms
That call fame on such gentle acts as these.
And he can spread thy name o'er lands and seas,
Whatever clime the sun's bright circle warms.

Lift not thy spear against the Muses' bower:
The great Emathian conqueror bid spare
The house of Pindarus, when temple and tower
Went to the ground: and the repeated air
Of sad Electra's poet had the power
To save the Athenian walls from ruin bare.",J. MILTON.,Golden Treasury,16.0,37.375,

To serve therewith my Maker, and present
My true account, lest He returning chide,—
Doth God exact day-labour, light denied?
I fondly ask:—But Patience, to prevent

That murmur, soon replies; God doth not need
Either man's work, or His own gifts: who best

And in short measures life may perfect be.",B. JONSON.,Golden Treasury,10.0,34.7,
TO MR,"LAWRENCE.

Lawrence, of virtuous father virtuous son,
Now that the fields are dank and ways are mire,

Help waste a sullen day, what may be won

From the hard season gaining? Time will run
On smoother, till Favonius re-inspire
The frozen earth, and cloth in fresh attire
The lily and rose, that neither sow'd nor spun.

What neat repast shall feast us, light and choice,
Of Attic taste, with wine, whence we may rise
To hear the lute well touch'd, or artful voice

In mirth, that after no repenting draws;
Let Euclid rest and Archimedes pause,
And what the Swede intends, and what the French.

To measure life learn thou betimes, and know
Toward solid good what leads the nearest way;
For other things mild Heaven a time ordains,

And disapproves that care, though wise in show,
That with superfluous burden loads the day,

 Forspent with love and shame. 
 But the olives they were not blind to Him, 
 The little gray leaves were kind to Him: 
 The thorn-tree had a mind to Him 
 When into the woods He came. 
  
 Out of the woods my Master went, 
 And He was well content. 
 Out of the woods my Master came, 
 Content with death and shame.

 Softly along the dim way to your room, 
 And found you sleeping in the quiet gloom, 
 And holiness about you as you slept. 
 I knelt there; till your waking fingers crept 
 About my head, and held it. I had rest 
 Unhoped this side of Heaven, beneath your breast. 
 I knelt a long time, still; nor even wept. 
  
 It was great wrong you did me; and for gain 
 Of that poor moment’s kindliness, and ease, 
 And sleepy mother-comfort!

 With the dusk of day was done;

 When a hazard has made them one.

 Bore thee far from me;

 Or the death they bear, 
 The heart which tender thought clothes like a dove 
 With the wings of care;

 Nor claim one smile for all the comfort, love, 
 It may bring to thee.",Percy Bysshe Shelley,PoemDB,17.0,33.47058823529412,

 Where'er the earth one fading trace 
 Of what was great and free does keep, 
 That is our home!... 
 Mild thoughts of man's ungentle race 
 Shall our contented exile reap; 
 For who that in some happy place 
 His own free thoughts can freely chase 
 By woods and waves can clothe his face 
 In cynic smiles? Child! we shall weep. 
  
 This lament, 
 The memory of thy grievous wrong 
 Will fade... 
 But genius is omnipotent 
 To hallow...",Percy Bysshe Shelley,PoemDB,16.0,29.0,

 The winter is lurking within my moods, 
 And the rustling of the withered leaf 
 Is the constant music of my grief....",Henry David Thoreau,PoemDB,19.0,35.68421052631579,

 And thou recall'st the broken vow

 There the potent sorrow, there the grief, 
 The pale, sad staring of Life's Tragedy. 
  
 To have come near to the perfect love, 
 Not the hot passion of untempered youth, 
 But that which lies aside its vanity, 
 And gives, for thy trusting worship, truth.

 Up, and do your duty duly! 
 There the wall--and there the Moat is: 
 Bouwah! Bouwah! Suliotes! 
 There is booty--there is Beauty, 
 Up my boys and do your duty. 
  
 By the sally and the rally 
 Which defied the arms of Ali; 
 By your own dear native Highlands, 
 By your children in the islands, 
 Up and charge, my Stratiotes, 
 Bouwah!--Bouwah!--Suliotes! 
  
 As our ploughshare is the Sabre: 
 Here's the harvest of our labour; 
 For behind those battered breaches 
 Are our foes with all their riches: 
 There is Glory--there is plunder-- 
 Then away despite of thunder!","George Gordon, Lord Byron",PoemDB,20.0,29.4,
Song. Translated From the Italian,"Oh! what is the gain of restless care, 
 And what is ambitious treasure? 
 And what are the joys that the modish share, 
 In their sickly haunts of pleasure? 
  
 My husband's repast with delight I spread, 
 What though 'tis but rustic fare, 
 May each guardian angel protect his shed, 
 May contentment and quiet be there. 
  
 And may I support my husband's years, 
 May I soothe his dying pain, 
 And then may I dry my fast falling tears, 
 And meet him in Heaven again.",Percy Bysshe Shelley,PoemDB,14.0,32.92857142857143,

 To Mr. H. Lawes, on his Aires. 
  
 Harry whose tuneful and well measur'd Song 
 First taught our English Musick how to span 
 Words with just note and accent, not to scan 
 With Midas Ears, committing short and long; 
 Thy worth and skill exempts thee from the throng, 
 With praise enough for Envy to look wan; 
 To after age thou shalt be writ the man, 
 That with smooth aire couldst humor best our tongue

 Breathed forth the sound that said 'I hate', 
 To me that languish'd for her sake: 
 But when she saw my woeful state, 
 Straight in her heart did mercy come, 
 Chiding that tongue that ever sweet 
 Was us'd in giving gentle doom; 
 And taught it thus anew to greet; 
 'I hate' she alter'd with an end, 
 That followed it as gentle day, 
 Doth follow night, who like a fiend 
 From heaven to hell is flown away.

Sonnet 19 - The soul's Rialto hath its merchandise,"XIX 
  
 The soul's Rialto hath its merchandise; 
 I barter curl for curl upon that mart, 
 And from my poet's forehead to my heart 
 Receive this lock which outweighs argosies,— 
 As purply black, as erst to Pindar's eyes 
 The dim purpureal tresses gloomed athwart 
 The nine white Muse-brows. For this counterpart, . . . 
 The bay-crown's shade, Beloved, I surmise, 
 Still lingers on thy curl, it is so black! 
 Thus, with a fillet of smooth-kissing breath, 
 I tie the shadows safe from gliding back, 
 And lay the gift where nothing hindereth; 
 Here on my heart, as on thy brow, to lack 
 No natural heat till mine grows cold in death.",Elizabeth Barrett Browning,PoemDB,16.0,39.25,
Sonnet 30 (Fire And Ice),"My love is like to ice, and I to fire: 
 how comes it then that this her cold so great

 but harder grows, the more I her entreat? 
  
 Or how comes it that my exceeding heat 
 is not delayed by her heart frozen cold, 
 but that I burn much more in boiling sweat, 
 and feel my flames augmented manifold? 
  
 What more miraculous thing may be told 
 that fire, which all thing melts, should harden ice: 
 and ice which is congealed with senseless cold, 
 should kindle fire by wonderful device?

 In color black why wrapp'd she beams so bright? 
 Would she in beamy black, like painter wise, 
 Frame daintiest lustre, mix'd of shades and light? 
  
 Or did she else that sober hue devise, 
 In object best to knit and strength our sight, 
 Lest if no veil those brave gleams did disguise, 
 They sun-like should more dazzle than delight? 
  
 Or would she her miraculous power show, 
 That whereas black seems Beauty's contrary, 
 She even if black doth make all beauties flow? 
  
 Both so and thus, she minding Love shoud be 
 Placed ever there, gave him this mourning weed, 
 To honor all their deaths, who for her bleed.",Sir Philip Sidney,PoemDB,17.0,38.94117647058823,
Sonnet XLI: Why Do I Speak of Joy,"Love's Lunacy 
  
 Why do I speak of joy, or write of love, 
 When my heart is the very den of horror, 
 And in my soul the pains of Hell I prove, 
 With all his torments and infernal terror? 
 What should I say? What yet remains to do? 
 My brain is dry with weeping all too long, 
 My sighs be spent in uttering my woe, 
 And I want words wherewith to tell my wrong; 
 But, still distracted in Love's lunacy, 
 And, bedlam-like, thus raging in my grief, 
 Now rail upon her hair, then on her eye, 
 Now call her Goddess, then I call her thief, 
 Now I deny her, then I do confess her, 
 Now do I curse her, then again I bless her.",Michael Drayton,PoemDB,16.0,38.625,
Sonnet XVI: In Nature Apt,"In nature apt to like when I did see

 My boiling sprites did thither soon incline, 
 And, Love, I thought that I was full of thee: 
  
 But finding not those restless flames in me, 
 Which others said did make their souls to pine, 
 I thought those babes of some pin's hurt did whine, 
 By my love judging what love's pain might be. 
  
 But while I thus with this young lion played, 
 Mine eyes (shall I say curst or blest?) beheld 
 Stella; now she is nam'd, need more be said?

 Who threaten'd stripes, if he his wrath did prove: 
 But she in chafe him from her lap did shove,

 Of stella's brows make him two better bows, 
 And in her eyes of arrows infinite.

 And thy youth past in this pure mirror see,

 Pass on, and to posterity tell this, 
 Yet see thou tell but truly what hath been;

Sonnet XXVI: I Ever Love,"To Despair 
  
 I ever love where never hope appears, 
 Yet hope draws on my never-hoping care, 
 And my life's hope would die, but for despair; 
 My never-certain joy breeds ever-certain fears; 
 Uncertain dread gives wings unto my hope, 
 Yet my hope's wings are laden so with fear 
 As they cannot ascend to my hope's sphere; 
 Though fear gives them more than a heav'nly scope, 
 Yet this large room is bounded with despair; 
 So my love is still fetter'd with vain hope, 
 And liberty deprives him of his scope, 
 And thus am I imprison'd in the air. 
 Then, sweet despair, awhile hold up thy head, 
 Or all my hope for sorrow will be dead.",Michael Drayton,PoemDB,16.0,39.4375,

 If French can yet three parts in one agree; 
 What now the Dutch in their full diets boast; 
 How Holland hearts, now so good towns be lost, 
 Trust in the shade of pleasing Orange tree; 
  
 How Ulster likes of that same golden bit 
 Wherewith my father once made it half tame; 
 If in the Scotch court be no welt'ring yet:

 And tax my Muse with this fantastic grace, 
 Turning my papers asks, ""What have we here?"" 
 Making withal some filthy antic face. 
 I fear no censure, nor what thou canst say, 
 Nor shall my spirit one jot of vigor lose; 
 Think'st thou my wit shall keep the pack-horse way 
 That every dudgen low invention goes? 
 Since sonnets thus in bundles are imprest 
 And every drudge doth dull our satiate ear,

 Aiming at things exceeding all perfection,

 Marvel not, Love, though I thy power admire,

 Blind were mine eyes, till they were seen of thine, 
 And mine ears deaf by thy fame healed be,

 By hellish Styx, by which the Thund'rer swears, 
 By thy fair mother's unavoided power, 
 By Hecate's names, by Proserpine's sad tears

 Spent on thine alters flaming up to heav'n,

And through the air their mingled music floats.

So may our breasts with ev'ry virtue glow,
The living temples of our God below!
Fill'd with the praise of him who gives the light,
And draws the sable curtains of the night,
Let placid slumbers sooth each weary mind,
At morn to wake more heav'nly, more refin'd;
So shall the labours of the day begin
More pure, more guarded from the snares of sin.

Then cease, my song, till fair Aurora rise.

While he shits on the can. 
Detain and confine,

it to my father on Interstate 542 had one
tooth, one sandal, and called me
""Duttah, Duttah."" I wanted to ask what is that, but the red buds teased me 
into our car and away from his fruit stand.
One bite. And if you eat it whole, it softens
and swells your teeth like a mouthful
of mallow. So how long before you lose
a sandal and still walk? How long
before you lose the sweetness?

Leaving work one blue August evening. Hell’s
So eloquent and poetry’s no fate at all

Waiting to wash its assassins away.

Le petit bout de rien,"
There's no cause for vanity and none for
pride: it's just a matter of assembling
words in lines, then dividing them up (or
letting them divide themselves), hoping
they sound good or bad. (What's important
is that they sound like something.) It's all
a question of staying alert so that red doesn't
bleed into orange or orange into yellow or
yellow into silence. There's no cause for
rejecting silence and none for accepting it,
either. We should speak when there's noth-
ing to say and be quiet when others talk.
That's the poet's business, so get used to it.
There's nothing glorious about it. The future
doesn't count for anything and the past just
laughs at us. There's no cause for writing
this poem and none for deleting it, either.

Contained in these full skins.

Of your winter’s grief.

less ferocious. The former sniff then poop,

Peered sepia eyes, blindered, unappeased
From a lair of brows and beard: one not amazed
At anything, as if to have looked enough
Then turned aside worked best for him—as if
Night vision was the discipline that eased
The weight of what he saw. A man’s gaze posed
Too long in the sun goes blank; comes to grief.
That face could be a focus for this back room,
For pack-rat papers strewn as if in rage,
Fond notes unread: each wary eye a phial
Unstopped to let huge Melville out, to calm
The sea of pages; Melville in older age:
The grown man’s sleepy defiance of denial.

In sin, the tongue
Cancels another year, another painted storm
In the coral caves, some pious poet
Drunk on vapors
Swatting tomb-bats in the nightwood, would that
Wayward bark sunned white
Be also thunder, a hill of bones drumming—thud
Thud, a wake
Of buzzards braiding into the loosening skull—the redoubled fists
Of students like an island in the bramble chained—I have been told
To reason, lawless, empty, without rights—
But I am old
Not age, I have been told
To match its columns by our footfall, prophet—I am not
The straw or garland of our Sirens, not the brow
Of holly, nor the warble
Of any lark

light bathed the empty siding all around

spires of churches, municipal arcades,

scrabbled snow, not lovely or deep,

And your tail twitching like a bothered lily,
And the taste of your own bleeding on the air, salt on the sweetness,
You with a fish's voice, singing and still
Your aria, and the blue-silver flecks of light,
The water's scales, breathing the breeze
Abundant and not for you, you with a hook,
Absurd, you with lidless mercuried eyes;
And the reel whistles, the tall man's cast at you.

A place to go to in his own direction,
How he had recomposed the pines,
Shifted the rocks and picked his way among clouds,
For the outlook that would be right,
Where he would be complete in an unexplained completion:
The exact rock where his inexactnesses
Would discover, at last, the view toward which they had edged,
Where he could lie and, gazing down at the sea,
Recognize his unique and solitary home.

I pulled the trigger ... blackness ... light ...
Unspeakable regret ... fumbling for the world again.

With lungs for breathing ... one cannot breathe here with lungs,

When no soul may ever escape the eternal destiny of life?

the spirit of the house is feminine,
its whisper of the one who, constantly,
draws letters that assume she has never gone.

The first act of love in a new house
is not private. Loving each other
we are half-aware of door and mirror.
Our ecstasy includes the bedside chair,
the air from the landing.
Street-lamp and elm utter leaves on walls
as in no room ever. Theirs is the tongue
our tongues join in translating. Their message
is clear: tonight you cannot ignore
the world at the window.
So we love in the knowledge of a city
at a different angle. And sharing
our bed with furniture and tree we claim
their perspective, merging our lives here
in their established frame.

Gary liked Teresa but Teresa
asked Elizabeth to tell Peter that
she really wanted to go out with him
but Peter had been making out with Jane
in the theater, celebrating their
one month anniversary, so that was
out, and even though Jane broke up with Pete,
Peter kept asking Gail to talk with Jane
which Gail wouldn't do because she'd told
Brenda that she thought that Peter was cute
but Brenda wasn't listening to a word,
wrapped up in lonely teardrops shed for Greg.

When I returned from the town at nightfall
      Notes continued to pour
As when I had left two hours before:
“It’s the very last time,” she said in closing;
       “From now I play no more.”
A few morns onward found her fading,

I thought of her playing her tunes right through;
And I felt she had known of what was coming,
      And wondered how she knew.

grows wise. Design undone. We wear time’s work.

Has no more purpose for a brain.

Guess which river. I have only a note,
a note taken in reading

I know is it seems
sensible, sustainable: no fish dies,
nobody ever gets so hungry he bites off more
than a tail; the sting, the trauma
keeps the bitten fish lean and alert.
The need to hide while regrowing a tail teaches guile.
They’ll eat smaller tails for a while.

shaken by bees, crow song probing eaves

Sesame. He waits and waits for egress.
The door needs only his touch.
Its only desire is to swing. He waits

a breeze-blown blemish long after he has arrived.
Long before he has come into being.

After Les Murray 



Inside the sandpit you are playing for your life. Your
bucket and spade that smiled all day long, like family
in your satchel, now work hard. Your material is sand. It weaves
a universe where you are huge, the cellar behind you,
eclipsed by twelve chestnut trees and their pigeon gods. On
and on you burrow, into your sanctuary, devotion’s
priest. There are rituals to do, like counting leaves on the sky’s loom.
Any lapse and you tumble back into the brain’s forks, rick-racking

hooded stranger with Papa’s voice, the makeshift bed.

was a kinda kind of soul
as your many poems attest. Those summer breezes.
Those many hazy sunsets nature’s voices echoing afar.
A life continually fulfilled bordering on the empty
and those inexplicable tragedies,
those bad timings unreconciled, then reconciled with time.
You had no answer that would satisfy your curiosity
and the why, the wherewithal just round the bend.
The morning mists descending in an angled quietude.
A birdcall here and there.
A rising wind unfurled and furling at the top-most branches of a conifer.

Children, never found where they were hiding
And hid with them, never followed

With a fingertip that still tingles.

Veiled and humming, soon enough.

In soft bright snatches? Do we need the snow,
Gentle as silence, covering the scars
Of weeks of hunger, years of shabby having?
Summer or winter? A heaven of stars? A room?
The smiling mouth, the sadness of desire
Are everywhere the same. If lovers go
Along an unknown road, they find no less
What is familiar. Let them stay at home,
And all will still be strange. This they know
Who with each heartbeat fight the fear of change.

The finger is also
Pressed by the stone.

In the deep night, alone,
Of her softness move
The airy thing
That presses upon her
With the whole weight of love? This
Sir Isaac said nothing of.

Passionate, ignored, as good as dumb,
Employed that O unchanged in repetition.

Use with him no reproaches whatsoever.
Ever you knew, supposing him to know
No melody from which you might recover-
Cover your ears, dear Echo, do not hear.

Only your sighs return upon the air
Ere their music from the mouth be gone.

Pale sot of the Maldive sea,
The sleek little pilot-fish, azure and slim,
How alert in attendance be.
From his saw-pit of mouth, from his charnel of maw
They have nothing of harm to dread,
But liquidly glide on his ghastly flank
Or before his Gorgonian head;
Or lurk in the port of serrated teeth
In white triple tiers of glittering gates,
And there find a haven when peril’s abroad,
An asylum in jaws of the Fates!
They are friends; and friendly they guide him to prey,
Yet never partake of the treat—
Eyes and brains to the dotard lethargic and dull,
Pale ravener of horrible meat.

Life spilled out onto the street, colors whirled
Cars & the variously shod feet were born
And the past & future & I born too

To Annapurna or Mt. McKinley
Or both but instantly
Clarified, composed, forever was I
Meant by her to recognize a painting
As beautiful or a movie stunning
And to adore the finitude of words
And understand as surfaces my dreams
Know the eye the organ of affection
And depths to be inflections
Of her voice & wrist & smile

carrying battered merchandise marked ROME

A stupid baby bib.

Ill weathers well, hail, gust and cold I bore,

Thus I lived then, till this air breathed on me.
Till this kind air breathed kindness everywhere,
There where my times had left me I would stay.

But now the wishful leaves have thronged the air.

Alas, kind element! which comes to go.

still in darkness. Here, where mystery
beyond hope comes too near,
make a bright flight of leaves
descend, none to smear all our spotless
rivers. A map folds and unfolds, does not
bunch or wrinkle. Rainbows to last.

Mixed with the summer scent of swelling plums,
A stench of putrid flesh and burning hair.
Here Lee was turned. That night the forest filled
With muttered names of loved ones left, and cries
From mangled soldiers pleading to be killed.

Say “nothing, nothing”—though “nothing” is a lie.

The axe, the rasp of salt against the skin,

Scored cheeks; the ligaments that rope the necks
Of lumberjacks; or the farmer’s gnarled wrist—
Compare these with the widow’s fisted look,
Then judge who has the most to bear. Think of
The ghost that each night slips between her sheets
Or of the sudden joy of being alone
Which troubles her for weeks. And you, who thought
Him mean, or too devoted to his drink,
Consider how the common fingerstones,
Bathed in the tidal slabs, grow luminous.

Early my heart a deeper lesson learnt;
Wandering alone by many a mile burnt
Black woodside, that but the snow-flake decks and drapes.
And I have stood beneath Canadian sky,
In utter solitudes, where the cricket’s cry
Appals the heart, and fear takes visible shapes;
And on Long Island’s void and isolate capes
Heard the sea break like iron bars: and still,
In all, I seemed to hear the same deep dirge;
Borne in the wind, the insect’s tiny trill,
And crash and jangle of the shaking surge;
And knew not what they meant,—prophetic woe?
Dim bodings, wherefore? Now, indeed, I know!

Myself in silver badge and riband blue,
My little sister with her book and slate;
The elm tree by the Pond, the fence of wood,
The burial place that at the corner stood
Where once we crossed, through the forbidden grate,
The stones that grudg’d us way, the graveside weed,
The ominous wind that turned us half about.
Smit the flying drops, at what a speed
Across the paths, unblessed and unforgiven
We hurried homeward when the day was late
And heard, with awe that left no place for doubt,
God’s anger mutter in the darkened heaven.

Back to the bars she knew and the repose
In love-rooms and the things in people's eyes.
Too vital and too squeaking. Must emerge.

Slops the bad wine across her shantung, talks
Of pregnancy, guitars and bridgework, walks
In parks or alleys, comes haply on the verge
Of happiness, haply hysterics. Is.

In monotone the lizard shrills his tune.

Where rushes grow, and oozing lichens cling.
Late cranes with heavy wing, and lazy flight,
Sail up the silence with the nearing night.

Steals twilight and its shadows o’er the swale.

Thick, grey and humid, while the marshes sleep.

When I was a child I knew red miners
dressed raggedly and wearing carbide lamps.
I saw them come down red hills to their camps
dyed with red dust from old Ishkooda mines.
Night after night I met them on the roads,
or on the streets in town I caught their glance;
the swing of dinner buckets in their hands,
and grumbling undermining all their words.
I also lived in low cotton country
where moonlight hovered over ripe haystacks,
or stumps of trees, and croppers’ rotting shacks
with famine, terror, flood, and plague near by;
where sentiment and hatred still held sway
and only bitter land was washed away.

My heart belongs to him and to him only;

Now grown to years advancing through the dozens
the honeyed kiss, the lips of wine and fire
fade blissfully into the distant years of yonder

are cradled in his arms and eyes entire.
They carry us under the waters of the world
out past the starposts of a distant planet
And creeping through the seaweed of the ocean
they tangle us with ropes and yarn of memories
where we have been together, you and I.

Dwells fear that you should fail. God placed no dart

Must ape her languor natural and pure.

Intones through steel the bitter pill:

Have done with dying and be dead.

Tickles the weeds there by its feet.

Yet to die. Unalone still.

Together you delight in the grandeur of the plains,
And the dark, the cold, the storms of snow.

A dog’s barking frightens, the wind cuts down.

Begs his shade for pittance.

Away in lines like seaweed on the tide
Or blades of wheat leaning under the wind.

Seemed that it briefly said, as I walked by,
Something I should have liked to say to you,
Something ... the dry grass bent under the pane
Brimful of bouncing water ... something of
A swaying clarity which blindly echoes
This lonely afternoon of memories
And missed desires, while the wintry rain

In the indiscriminate green
Of summer or in earliest snow
A landscape is another scene,
Inchoate and anonymous,
And every rock and bush and drift
As our affections alter us
Will alter with the season’s shift.

As through the exclusions of a rhyme,
Or the exactions of a past,
To the simplicity of time,
The antiquity of grace, where yet
We live in terror and delight
With love as quiet as regret
And love like anger in the night.

In vain; then even the monsters we defy
Shall be constrained to honor us though dead!

And for their thousand blows deal one death-blow!

Like men we’ll face the murderous, cowardly pack,
Pressed to the wall, dying, but fighting back!

Who, moving others, are themselves as stone,
Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow:
They rightly do inherit heaven's graces
And husband nature's riches from expense;
They are the lords and owners of their faces,
Others but stewards of their excellence.
The summer's flower is to the summer sweet
Though to itself it only live and die,
But if that flower with base infection meet,
The basest weed outbraves his dignity:
For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds;
Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds.

What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!
What old December's bareness everywhere!

The teeming autumn, big with rich increase,
Bearing the wanton burthen of the prime,
Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease:
Yet this abundant issue seem'd to me
But hope of orphans and unfather'd fruit;
For summer and his pleasures wait on thee,
And thou away, the very birds are mute;
Or if they sing, 'tis with so dull a cheer
That leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near.

A face. Having lived with such strict beauty
She comes to know how the sun is nothing
But itself and the path it throws; the moon
A riddled stone. If only a hand
Would tremble along her cheek, would disturb. Even the elk
Pass by, drawn to the spill of creeks below—
How she cannot help abundance, even as it leaves
Her, as it sings all the way down the mountain.

drawn through his maze of iron composition
by the incomparable wandering voice of Phèdre.
When I was troubled in mind, you made for my body
caught in its hangman's-knot of sinking lines,
the glassy bowing and scraping of my will. . . .
I have sat and listened to too many
words of the collaborating muse,
and plotted perhaps too freely with my life,
not avoiding injury to others,
not avoiding injury to myself—

Shooting Rats at the Bibb County Dump,"
Loaded on beer and whiskey, we ride 
to the dump in carloads
to turn our headlights across the wasted field, 
freeze the startled eyes of rats against mounds of rubbish.

Shot in the head, they jump only once, lie still 
like dead beer cans.
Shot in the gut or rump, they writhe and try to burrow 
into garbage, hide in old truck tires, 
rusty oil drums, cardboard boxes scattered across the mounds,
or else drag themselves on forelegs across our beams of light 
toward the darkness at the edge of the dump.

""What will you be?--

Sexism,"
The happiest moment in a woman's life
Is when she hears the turn of her lover's key
In the lock, and pretends to be asleep
When he enters the room, trying to be
Quiet but clumsy, bumping into things,
And she can smell the liquor on his breath
But forgives him because she has him back
And doesn't have to sleep alone.

The happiest moment in a man's life
Is when he climbs out of bed
With a woman, after an hour's sleep,
After making love, and pulls on
His trousers, and walks outside,
And pees in the bushes, and sees
The high August sky full of stars
And gets in his car and drives home.",David Lehman,Poets.Org,18.0,31.88888888888889," From Valentine Place, published by Scribner. Copyright © 1996 by David Lehman. All rights reserved. Reprinted by permission of the author. "

And trained us in the virtues we most lacked.

Correctly, without fear.  Unless I could,

Of the library steps, there lurked
A Mercury of rust, its cab half-lit.

Shiloh: A Requiem,"
Skimming lightly, wheeling still,
  The swallows fly low
Over the field in clouded days,
  The forest-field of Shiloh—
Over the field where April rain
Solaced the parched ones stretched in pain
through the pause of night
That followed the Sunday fight
  Around the church of Shiloh—
The church so lone, the log-built one,
That echoed to many a parting groan
 	And natural prayer
  Of dying foemen mingled there—
Foemen at morn, but friends at eve—

(What like a bullet can undeceive!)

While over them the swallows skim,
  And all is hushed at Shiloh.",Herman Melville,Poets.Org,20.0,29.6, This poem is in the public domain.

Was one I know you never do.

Summer Holiday,"
When the sun shouts and people abound
One thinks there were the ages of stone and the age of
     bronze
And the iron age; iron the unstable metal;
Steel made of iron, unstable as his mother; the tow-

Will be stains of rust on mounds of plaster.
Roots will not pierce the heaps for a time, kind rains
     will cure them,
Then nothing will remain of the iron age

Anecdote of the Jar,"
I placed a jar in Tennessee,
And round it was, upon a hill.
It made the slovenly wilderness
Surround that hill.

The wilderness rose up to it,
And sprawled around, no longer wild.
The jar was round upon the ground
And tall and of a port in air.

It took dominion everywhere.
The jar was gray and bare.
It did not give of bird or bush,
Like nothing else in Tennessee.",Wallace Stevens,Poets.Org,15.0,23.6," From Collected Poems of Wallace Stevens by Wallace Stevens. Copyright © 1954 by Wallace Stevens. Used by permission of Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. "

The Blue Cup,"
Through binoculars the spiral nebula was
a smudged white thumbprint on the night sky.
Stories said it was a mark left by the hand
of Night, that old she, easily weaving
the universe out of milky strings of chaos.

Beatrice found creation more difficult.
Tonight what she had was greasy water
whirling in the bottom of her sink, revolution,
and one clean cup.

                    She set the blue cup
down on the table, spooned instant coffee, poured
boiling water, a thread of sweetened milk. Before
she went back to work, she drank the galaxy that spun

Old English riddle,"
My dress is silent when I tread the ground 
Or stay at home or stir upon the waters.
Sometimes my trappings and the lofty air
Raise me above the dwelling-place of men,
And then the power of clouds carries me far

"I Wake and Feel the Fell of Dark, Not Day","
I wake and feel the fell of dark, not day.
What hours, O what black hours we have spent
This night! what sights you, heart, saw; ways you went!
And more must, in yet longer light's delay.

With witness I speak this. But where I say
Hours I mean years, mean life. And my lament
Is cries countless, cries like dead letters sent
To dearest him that lives alas! away.

I am gall, I am heartburn. God's most deep decree
Bitter would have me taste: my taste was me;
Bones built in me, flesh filled, blood brimmed the curse.

Selfyeast of spirit a dull dough sours. I see 
The lost are like this, and their scourge to be
As I am mine, their sweating selves, but worse.

Plain in thy neatness? O how oft shall he

Who always vacant always amiable

His father cast light line out over
The willows.  He's forgotten his 
Father has been dead for two years
And the lake is where a blue fog
Rolls, and the sky could be, if it
Were black or blue or white,
The backdrop of all attention.

He wades out to join the father,
Following where the good strikes
Seem to lead.  It's cold.  The shape
Breath takes on a cold day is like

In the middle of every field,
obscured from the side by grass

she works burying swans alive
into the black earth. She only
buries their bodies, their wings.
She packs the dirt tight around
their noodle necks & they shake
like long eyelashes in a hurricane.
She makes me feed them by hand
twice a day for one full year: grain,
bits of chopped fish. Then she
takes me to the tin toolshed.
Again she shows me the world
inside her silver transistor radio.
She hands me the scythe.

Sonnet for Salvadore,"
Of Salvadore the Celery King I sing. 
Illiterate in Lewiston, he'd wander, 
so I'm told, into the ladies' john 
and, barring ladies, not suspect a thing. 
But when it came to celery, he was king. 
And when he died, the Idaho Daily Sun 
said: Salvadore the Celery King Moves On. 
The celery hung its head, remembering.

Sometimes I think I'll wind down Lewiston Hill 
(where winding up and winding down's the same 
except for purpose), enter past the mill 
and, turning to face the crowd, announce my name:

the King, whose throne I've come to claim.""

You are as gold 
as the half-ripe grain 
that merges to gold again, 
as white as the white rain 
that beats through 
the half-opened flowers 
of the great flower tufts 
thick on the black limbs 
of an Illyrian apple bough.

  Can honey distill such fragrance 
As your bright hair—
For your face is as fair as rain, 
  yet as rain that lies clear 
  on white honey-comb,
lends radiance to the white wax, 
so your hair on your brow 
casts light for a shadow.

I undo my hair slowly:
                a plum calyx is

I wake dazed when smoke
        breaks my spring sleep.
The dream distant,
                so very distant;
        and it is quiet, so very quiet.
The moon spins and spins.
The kingfisher blinds are drawn;

        and yet I possess these moments of time!

on the back of my neck,
a man's voice low

brags down my throat

he does not touch me.

Panty Raid,"
It is 1974 and out the institutional open windows 
of the college dorm, nylon bikinis in floral prints 
are plummeting like the cheap bodies of birds. And then

your mother's large white briefs like a mainsail, like 
a flag of surrender, begin a slow dancing down current, 
cinematic, lithe. All of the faces
are turning up, hushed, like those
holding a hoop to save a child burning. It is the opposite

of being lifted into the sky
the way I imagined my grandfather ascending 
after the long pain of illness: this large pair of underpants 
falling forever on the startled face
of an undergraduate boy.

The song itself had hinges. The clasp on the eighteenth-century Bible

the joints, the weight of each side straining them.

Here once the embattled farmers stood,
    And fired the shot heard round the world.

And Time the ruined bridge has swept
    Down the dark stream which seaward creeps.

That memory may their deed redeem,
    When, like our sires, our sons are gone.

The Woodspurge,"
The wind flapped loose, the wind was still,
Shaken out dead from tree and hill:
I had walked on at the wind's will,--
I sat now, for the wind was still.

Between my knees my forehead was,--
My lips, drawn in, said not Alas!
My hair was over in the grass,
My naked ears heard the day pass.

My eyes, wide open, had the run
Of some ten weeds to fix upon;
Among those few, out of the sun,
The woodspurge flowered, three cups in one.

From perfect grief there need not be
Wisdom or even memory:
One thing then learnt remains to me,--
The woodspurge has a cup of three.",Dante Gabriel Rossetti,Poets.Org,20.0,27.35, This poem is in the public domain.

The tide rises, the tide falls,
The twilight darkens, the curlew calls;

The traveller hastens toward the town,

Darkness settles on roofs and walls,
But the sea, the sea in darkness calls;
The little waves, with their soft, white hands,
Efface the footprints in the sands,
    And the tide rises, the tide falls.

The morning breaks; the steeds in their stalls
Stamp and neigh, as the hostler calls;
The day returns, but nevermore

To Sleep I give my powers away;
    My will is bondsman to the dark;

And with my heart I muse and say:

O heart, how fares it with thee now,
    That thou should fail from thy desire,
    Who scarcely darest to inquire,
""What is it makes me beat so low?""

Something it is which thou hast lost,
    Some pleasure from thine early years.
    Break thou deep vase of chilling tears,
That grief hath shaken into frost!

Such clouds of nameless trouble cross
    All night below the darkened eyes;
    With morning wakes the will, and cries,

Ants and Sharks,"
For A. B.


An ant devours a larva, in accord
with nature, and a child then eats the ant —
it burns on the tongue. Curiosity
always burns. On Paradise Beach in Goa,

a shark will eat the child, but when God sees,
he'll catch the shark, just as he grabs a rat,
a tigress, elephant. The poet in his room
will then eat God. He'll feed on everything.
He is a monster like a boar that bloats,
excretes. He feeds on paper. If you let
him in, he'll find your dreams, love's traces on
the sheets — he'll steal what's holy, masticate,

grow pasty flesh, poisonous fur. It's enough
to touch him or brush by on accident.",Tomasz Rózycki,Poets.Org,20.0,29.6," From The Literary Review (Fall, 2008). Copyright © 2008 by Mira Rosenthal. Used by permission. "

from the stall next to mine. We're standing,
hidden from each other on opposite sides

her brother's hand surprising itself
inside some girl's sweater, small hairs jittery
along the map of her neck. Her eyes were shut.
I open mine wide, lean closer.

I form my mouth into an 0, press my lips
against the door. He was licking her ear.

a horse in a stall spooked by guttering candles, 
the popping and black smoke, the quivering flanks.

And if a horse, in its loneliness, couldn't manage 
to speak, what difference did it make? 
What could he say? Tell a flickering candle Burn true?

in her hair. She was surrounded by deer, statues
in a circle around her.

Springing,"
In a skiff on a sunrisen lake we are watchers.

Swimming aimlessly is luxury just as walking 
loudly up a shallow stream is.

As we lean over the deep well, we whisper.

Friends at hearths are drawn to the one warm air; 
strangers meet on beaches drawn to the one wet sea.

What wd it be to be water, one body of water 
(what water is is another mystery) (We are 
water divided.) It wd be a self without walls, 
with surface tension, specific gravity a local
exchange between bedrock and cloud of falling and rising, 
rising to fall, falling to rise.

Skylab,"
We've come so far, thought the astronaut
as he swam around the capsule in his third week
and by accident kicked a god in the eye
—so far
that there's no difference anymore between up and down,
north and south, heavy and light.
And how, then, can we know righteousness.

So far. 
And weightless, in a sealed room
we chase the sunrises at high speed
and sicken with longing for a green stalk
or the heft of something in our hands. Lifting a stone. 

One night he saw that the Earth was like an open eye
that looked at him as gravely as the eye of a child
awakened in the middle of the night. ",Rolf Jacobsen,Poets.Org,18.0,31.944444444444443," From North in the World: Selected Poems of Rolf Jacobsen, translated and edited by Roger Greenwald.

June Light,"
Your voice, with clear location of June days,
Called me outside the window.  You were there,
Light yet composed, as in the just soft stare
Of uncontested summer all things raise
Plainly their seeming into seamless air.

Then your love looked as simple and entire
As that picked pear you tossed me, and your face
As legible as pearskin's fleck and trace,
Which promise always wine, by mottled fire
More fatal fleshed than ever human grace.

And your gay gift—Oh when I saw it fall
Into my hands, through all that naïve light,
It seemed as blessed with truth and new delight
As must have been the first great gift of all.",Richard Wilbur,Poets.Org,17.0,35.588235294117645,None

Parable with Broken Frame,"
An old architect at a littered worktable
     sits through morning, eyes fixed on ocean,
intent through evening at the study window,
     motionless though his hand rebuilds years.

Down razory defiles to the rockledge landing
     stands of flittergold awash in wind,
and through soft lolling labia of the waves
     tiny boats coming in, setting out.
   
Priest and corpsedresser begin the climb to his house,
     their empty craft nibbles at spindrift.
A bridegroom and his man steer for the islands,
     plinky music unrolls with their wake.

Sometimes
When I feel like I'm going to fall apart
I hold my ribs, all the way around,
Both sides.
My ribs hold me together,
Like glue.
They keep my breath close to my heartbeat.
They keep my soul from escaping and 
Leaving me, grounded.
I hold brightness and shadows in 
The hollow where my ribs meet.
I hold them there in the memories
Of slow, sorrowful music and
Porch steps.
I hold my ribs, until I feel solid.

My fingers are fruit.",Ember Ward,Poets.Org,18.0,25.33333333333333," From Paint Me Like I Am: Teen Poems from WritersCorps, introduced by Nikki Giovanni. Copyright © 2003 by Ember Ward. Reprinted by permission of by HarperCollins Children's Books. All rights reserved. "

The dusk has caught them cold.
Swift darkness gathers up the sun,
And all the beckoning gold
That guides them safely into port

And Venus, salty-eyed.

Our mower is young and broad-shouldered:
so were we. Love confuses him as it once did us;
the pain he feels he believes to be genuine.
He even believes it to be pain.

the handless man scratches his face like a housecat,
the mower mows and our grief is where it was.

II
We remember some things, but nothing
so exact as form or color or disposition.

paper shoes and speaks in insect languages.

it seals us up. Death is also a mower,

Nor I half turn to go yet turning stay.
Remember me when no more day by day

It will be late to counsel then or pray.
Yet if you should forget me for a while

Gold,"
Pale gold of the walls, gold
of the centers of daisies, yellow roses
pressing from a clear bowl. All day
we lay on the bed, my hand
stroking the deep
gold of your thighs and your back.
We slept and woke
entering the golden room together,
lay down in it breathing 
quickly, then
slowly again,
caressing and dozing, your hand sleepily
touching my hair now.

We made in those days
tiny identical rooms inside our bodies

Naming,"
Let me tell you this once
(I will not be able to say it again):
I have lost the meaning of words.
Heavy, they ripped away from the sounds,
fell into cracked ground. For weeks
I scratched but what I dug up was
bicycle spokes, black melon rinds,
a smashed doll face--it was not meaning.
I don't know what I am saying.

I exaggerate. Not everything is gone.
I still know perfectly what sugar means,
and pine needle. Laughter is more
of a problem. And yellow often slides,
a plate of butter in the sun.
The meaning of flower has gone entirely;
so has the meaning of love. Now it is safe
to say: I love you. Now it is true.",Nancy Mairs,Poets.Org,19.0,31.68421052631579, This poem is reprinted with the permission of Confluence Press from In All the Rooms of the Yellow House. Copyright © 1984 by Nancy Mairs. All rights reserved. 
"Central Park, Carousel","
June already, it's your birth month,
nine months since the towers fell.
I set olive twigs in my hair
torn from a tree in Central Park,
I ride a painted horse, its mane a sullen wonder.
You are behind me on a lilting mare.
You whisper--What of happiness?
Dukham, Federico. Smoke fills my eyes.
Young, I was raised to a sorrow song
short fires and stubble on a monsoon coast.
The leaves in your cap are very green.
The eyes of your mare never close.

Inside the Stove,"
Inside the stove, he found 
a passageway, leading to a set of stairs.
This caused him a great deal of worry
as well as elation and gladness of living.
He did not, however, venture
into the oven, but sent his little brother in
in his stead. This seemed at first 
a good idea, but when the brother
had been gone three days, he began 
to second-guess the wisdom
of his rash choice. He'd go in after him,
he decided. But the passage
had shrunk by then, and no normal-sized
person could fit through. Yes, that's it,
I sent him in because, from a purely physical
standpoint, I myself could never have gone.
And besides, he mumbled to himself,
it's probably nice in there.",Jesse Ball,Poets.Org,19.0,34.1578947368421, From March Book by Jesse Ball. Copyright © 2004 by Jesse Ball. Reprinted by permission of Grove Press. All rights reserved. 
The Path,"
There is so little to go on: a pale
trembling hand as I stand over you,
my finger tracing the words on the page,
a foreign language you are learning
for a journey without me. You will do
fine, I say. You will wrap your tongue
around these sounds and be understood,
be given what you desire: a loaf of bread,
change for your money, an antique doll
with violent eyes. Paintings are hanging
on walls, behind glass, waiting for you
to admire them. Their plaintive beauty
will move through you and you will walk
back to your hotel through the park

its bridle path, a gray cat in my arms,
moving toward you, blind, in another life.",Emily Fragos,Poets.Org,18.0,36.16666666666666, From Little Savage by Emily Fragos. Copyright © 2004 by Emily Fragos. Reprinted by permission of Grove Press. All rights reserved.

Sky,"
He broke up the sky on the square and gave it like bread crumbs to birds.
Then he cut it in pieces and threw it to the beggars,
the crazies, the blind, and their companions.
But I got an end, smashed like a cup thrown to the ground,

lying on its back like a wounded soldier,
uncomplaining, as a harem wife
hiding her gaze behind a black veil.
The plains' bed is spread with houses, and everyone

beneath it ages like a slave chained in bondage; 
save his high-cheek-boned face.
Tensing my voice I started to refuse my free portion.

Outside,"
The dead thing mashed into the street
the crows are squabbling over isn't
her, nor are their raucous squawks
the quiet cawing from her throat
those final hours she couldn't speak.
But the racket irks him.
It seems a cruel intrusion into grief
so mute it will never be expressed
no matter how loud or long the wailing
he might do. Nor could there be a word
that won't debase it, no matter
how kind or who it comes from.
She knew how much he loved her.
That must be his consolation
when he must talk to buy necessities.
Every place will be a place without her.

pushing a shopping cart or fetching mail
is just a neatly dressed polite old man. ",Michael Ryan,Poets.Org,20.0,33.15, From New and Selected Poems by Michael Ryan. Copyright © 2004 by Michael Ryan. Reprinted by permission of Houghton Mifflin. All rights reserved.

A moment from a life--a husband holding up
A tee-shirt for cursory inspection;
A child trudging home from a dull school day;
A tree in heavy wind--when placed within

The careful rails of verse acquires the dear,
Facile pout of meaning. It's a feeling
Rather than a faith since faith knows
Its way beforehand, while this telling us

A seeking. We read under the beneficence
Of a minor spell. Even the pain comforts:
Any life does; any avenue counts.

The child stops at a puddle and peers into

a bridge that leaps from her hot red hands
and hangs there shining for fifty years
over the mystified chickens, 
over the swaying nettles, the ragweed,
the clay slope down to the creek, 
over the redwing blackbirds in the tops
of the willows, a glorious rainbow
with an empty dishpan swinging at one end.

Parowan Canyon,"
When granite and sandstone begin to blur
and flow, the eye rests on cool white aspen.
Strange, their seeming transparency.
How as in a sudden flash one remembers
a forgotten name, so the recollection. Aspen.
With a breeze in them, their quiet rhythms,
shimmering, quaking. Powder on the palm.
Cool on the cheek. Such delicacy
the brittle wood, limbs snapping
at a grasp, whole trees tumbling in the winds.
Sweet scent on a swollen afternoon.
Autumn, leaves falling one upon another, gold
rains upon a golden earth. How at evening
when the forest darkens, aspen do not.
And a white moon rises and silver stars
point toward the mountain, darkness
holds them so pale.
They stand still, very still.

your daughter's painting of a large frilled cabbage
against a dark sky with pinpoints of stars.
The eager vegetable, opening itself 
as if to eat the air, or speak in cabbage
language of the meanings within meanings;
while the points of stars hide their massive
violence in the dark upper half of the painting.
You can live with this.

A Grin,"
Begun under the bed of the poorest shanty
It ran through the mattress and suffered the chinches
And it ran through the veins of the farmer and his wife

It came fraying the laces of his brogans
Like the plow of a furrow's sweep

But the Grin was too broad

After a Death,"
Once there was a shock
that left behind a long, shimmering comet tail.
It keeps us inside. It makes the TV pictures snowy.
It settles in cold drops on the telephone wires.

One can still go slowly on skis in the winter sun
through brush where a few leaves hang on.
They resemble pages torn from old telephone directories.
Names swallowed by the cold.

but often the shadow seems more real than the body.

The Cross of Snow,"
In the long, sleepless watches of the night,
A gentle face--the face of one long dead--
Looks at me from the wall, where round its head
The night-lamp casts a halo of pale light.
Here in this room she died, and soul more white
Never through martyrdom of fire was led
To its repose; nor can in books be read
The legend of a life more benedight.
There is a mountain in the distant West
That, sun-defying, in its deep ravines
Displays a cross of snow upon its side.
Such is the cross I wear upon my breast
These eighteen years, through all the changing scenes
And seasons, changeless since the day she died.",Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,Poets.Org,15.0,39.46666666666667, This poem is in the public domain.

Why should a foolish marriage vow, 
  Which long ago was made,
Oblige us to each other now

But our marriage is dead, when the pleasure is fled:

What wrong has he whose joys did end,

To know. But the nurse attached
Its greasy patches to his chest to read.

And out, there is a point of singularity.

For instance, the heart wears the costume

Beneath Speech,"

Pink was pink all the way through, like any organ might be,

Night was a starry dish. One side convex, one side concave.

This must be like winter for fish, she thought,

The name, because one afternoon
Of heat the express-train drew up there
Unwontedly. It was late June. 

The steam hissed. Someone cleared his throat.

Was Adlestrop—only the name

And meadowsweet, and haycocks dry,
No whit less still and lonely fair
Than the high cloudlets in the sky.

my daughter balanced on the couch back,
fell and cut her mouth.

And so is the cat-a-mountain,

And the frog peeps out o' the fountain;
The dogs they do bay, and the timbrels play,
The spindle is now a turning;
The moon it is red, and the stars are fled,
But all the sky is a-burning:

The ditch is made, and our nails the spade,
With pictures full, of wax and of wool;
Their livers I stick, with needles quick;
There lacks but the blood, to make up the flood.
Quickly, Dame, then bring your part in,

Merrily, merrily, make him fail,
A worm in his mouth, and a thorn in his tail,

Herb Garden,"
""And these, small, unobserved . . . "" —Janet Lewis

The lizard, an exemplar of the small,
Spreads fine, adhesive digits to perform
Vertical push-ups on a sunny wall;
Bees grapple spikes of lavender, or swarm
The dill's gold umbels and low clumps of thyme.
Bored with its trellis, a resourceful rose
Has found a nearby cedar tree to climb
And to festoon with floral furbelows.

Though the great, heat-stunned sunflower looks half-dead
The way it, shepherd's crook-like, hangs its head,
The herbs maintain their modest self-command:
Their fragrances and colors warmly mix
While, quarrying between the pathway’s bricks,
Ants build minute volcanoes out of sand.",Timothy Steele,Poets.Org,18.0,35.666666666666664," ""Herb Garden"" from Toward the Winter Solstice (Swallow Press/Ohio University Press, 2006, www.ohioswallow.com). "

Christmas was in the air and all was well
With him, but for a few confusing flaws
In divers of God's images. Because

Partly, a slowly freezing Santa Claus
Upon the corner, with his beard and bell.

He magnified a fancy that he wished
The friend whom he had wrecked were here again.

And from the fulness of his heart he fished
A dime for Jesus who had died for men.",Edwin Arlington Robinson,Poets.Org,16.0,34.6875, This poem is in the public domain.

Our lady of strange dreams, and from an urn 
She poured live fire, so that mine eyes did burn 
At the sight of it.  Anon the floating fame 
Took many shapes, and one cried: ""I am shame 
That walks with Love, I am most wise to turn 
Cold lips and limbs to fire; therefore discern 
And see my loveliness, and praise my name."" 

And afterwords, in radiant garments dressed 
With sound of flutes and laughing of glad lips, 
A pomp of all the passions passed along 
All the night through; till the white phantom ships 
Of dawn sailed in. Whereat I said this song, 
""Of all sweet passions Shame is the loveliest.""",Lord Alfred Douglas,Poets.Org,16.0,39.9375, This poem is in the public domain.

Is love a fancy, or a feeling? No.

Drops from the stem of life—for it will grow,
In barren regions, where no waters flow,
Nor rays of promise cheats the pensive gloom.
A darkling fire, faint hovering o'er a tomb,
That but itself and darkness nought doth show,
It is my love's being yet it cannot die,
Nor will it change, though all be changed beside;
Though fairest beauty be no longer fair,
Though vows be false, and faith itself deny,
Though sharp enjoyment be a suicide,
And hope a spectre in a ruin bare.",Hartley Coleridge,Poets.Org,15.0,38.266666666666666, This poem is in the public domain.

Room after room,
I hunt the house through
We inhabit together.
Heart, fear nothing, for, heart, thou shalt find her,
Next time, herself!—not the trouble behind her
Left in the curtain, the couch's perfume!
As she brushed it, the cornice-wreath blossomed anew,— 
Yon looking-glass gleamed at the wave of her feather.

Yet the day wears,
And door succeeds door;
I try the fresh fortune— 
Range the wide house from the wing to the centre.
Still the same chance! she goes out as I enter.
Spend my whole day in the quest,—who cares?
But 'tis twilight, you see,—with such suites to explore,
Such closets to search, such alcoves to importune!

I dream of you, to wake: would that I might 
Dream of you and not wake but slumber on; 
Nor find with dreams the dear companion gone, 
As, Summer ended, Summer birds take flight. 
In happy dreams I hold you full in night. 
I blush again who waking look so wan; 
Brighter than sunniest day that ever shone, 
In happy dreams your smile makes day of night. 
Thus only in a dream we are at one, 
Thus only in a dream we give and take 
The faith that maketh rich who take or give;

To die were surely sweeter than to live, 
Though there be nothing new beneath the sun.",Christina Rossetti,Poets.Org,15.0,39.6, This poem is in the public domain.

First hour, first moment of your meeting me,

So unrecorded did it slip away, 
So blind was I to see and to foresee, 
So dull to mark the budding of my tree 
That would not blossom for many a May. 
If only I could recollect it, such 
A day of days! I let it come and go 
As traceless as a thaw of bygone snow; 
It seemed to mean so little, meant so much;

The First Marriage,"
for Gretchen and Herb: June 15, 1991


imagine the very first marriage a girl
and boy trembling with some inchoate
need for ceremony a desire for witness:
inventing formality like a wheel or a hoe

in a lost language in a clearing too far from here
a prophet or a prophetess intoned to the lovers
who knelt with their hearts cresting
like the unnamed ocean thinking This is true

thinking they will never be alone again
though planets slip their tracks and fish
desert the sea repeating those magic sounds
meaning I do on this stone below
this tree before these friends yes in body
and word my darkdream my sunsong yes I do I do",Peter Meinke,Poets.Org,20.0,30.55, Copyright © 1996 by Peter Meinke. From Scars by Peter Meinke. Reprinted by permission of the University of Pittsburgh Press.

"A Shropshire Lad, XXXVI","
White in the moon the long road lies,  
  The moon stands blank above;  
White in the moon the long road lies  
  That leads me from my love.  
  
Still hangs the hedge without a gust,
  Still, still the shadows stay:  
My feet upon the moonlit dust  
  Pursue the ceaseless way.  
  
The world is round, so travellers tell,  
  And straight though reach the track,  
Trudge on, trudge on, ’twill all be well,  
  The way will guide one back.  
  
But ere the circle homeward hies  
  Far, far must it remove:  
White in the moon the long road lies  
  That leads me from my love. ",A. E. Housman,Poets.Org,20.0,28.2, This poem is in the public domain.

Atlantis—A Lost Sonnet,"
How on earth did it happen, I used to wonder
that a whole city—arches, pillars, colonnades,

one fine day gone under?

Surely a great city must have been missed?
I miss our old city —

white pepper, white pudding, you and I meeting 
under fanlights and low skies to go home in it. Maybe 
what really happened is 

this: the old fable-makers searched hard for a word

never found it. And so, in the best traditions of

Mother,"
What you do with time
is what a grandmother clock
does with it: strike twelve
and take its time doing it.
You’re the clock: time passes,
you remain. And wait.

Waiting is what happens to
a snow-covered garden, 
a trunk under moss,
hope for better times
in the nineteenth century,

grow moldy together, like grapes
turning into wine, reality into preserves,

in the cellar of yourself. ",Herman de Coninck,Poets.Org,20.0,22.05," From The Plural of Happiness: Selected Poems of Herman de Coninck, translated by Laure-Anne Bosselaar and Kurt Brown, Oberlin College Press, © 2006. Reprinted with permission of Oberlin College Press. "

A big room with heavy wooden tables that sat on a creaky

A line of green shades—bankers’ lights—down the center
Heavy oak chairs that were too low or maybe I was simply
too short

So my first book was always big

In the foyer up four steps a semi-circle desk presided
To the left side the card catalogue
On the right newspapers draped over what looked like
a quilt rack
Magazines face out from the wall

Poem Beginning with a Line by John Ashbery,"
Jealousy.  Whispered weather reports.
The lure of the land so strong it prompts
gossip: we chatter like small birds
at the edge of the ocean gray, foaming.

Now sand under sand hides
the buried world, the one in which our fathers failed,
the palm frond a dangerous truth
they once believed, and touched.  Bloodied their hands.

They once believed.  And, touched, bloodied their hands;

Scumble,"
What if I were turned on by seemingly innocent words such as
   ""scumble,"" ""pinky,""

or ""extrapolate?""  

What if I maneuvered conversation in the hope that others would
   pronounce these words?  

Perhaps the excitement would come from the way the other person
   touched them lightly and carelessly with his tongue.  

What if ""of"" were such a hot button?

""Scumble of bushes.""

None so devotional as that of ""Mother,""
Therefore by that dear name I long have called you—
You who are more than mother unto me,
And fill my heart of hearts, where Death installed you
In setting my Virginia's spirit free.
My mother—my own mother, who died early,
Was but the mother of myself; but you
Are mother to the one I loved so dearly,
And thus are dearer than the mother I knew

Was dearer to my soul than its soul-life.",Edgar Allan Poe,Poets.Org,15.0,38.53333333333333, This poem is in the public domain. 
Smoke,"

That I may greatly disappoint my friends,
Howe'er they think or hope that it may be,
They may not dream how thou'st distinguished me.

The heart of a woman goes forth with the dawn,
As a lone bird, soft winging, so restlessly on,

He came in silvern armour, trimmed with black—
A lover come from legends long ago—
With silver spurs and silken plumes a-blow,
And flashing sword caught fast and buckled back
In a carven sheath of Tamarack.
He came with footsteps beautifully slow,
And spoke in voice meticulously low.
He came and Romance followed in his track...

I did not ask his name—I thought him Love;
I did not care to see his hidden face.
All life seemed born in my intaken breath;
All thought seemed flown like some forgotten dove.

Such things as flowers bathed by rain
Or patterns traced upon the sea
Or crocuses where snow has lain ...

Azaleas and the scent of them,
And honeysuckles in the night.
And many sounds are also dear—
Like winds that sing among the trees

Or Negroes humming melodies.

Are sudden tear-drops in your eyes.",Gwendolyn Bennett,Poets.Org,15.0,29.8, This poem is in the public domain.

Of Many Worlds in This World,"
Just like as in a nest of boxes round,
Degrees of sizes in each box are found:
So, in this world, may many others be
Thinner and less, and less still by degree:
Although they are not subject to our sense,
A world may be no bigger than two-pence.
Nature is curious, and such works may shape,
Which our dull senses easily escape:
For creatures, small as atoms, may there be,
If every one a creature’s figure bear.
If atoms four, a world can make, then see
What several worlds might in an ear-ring be:
For, millions of those atoms may be in
The head of one small, little, single pin.

Achilles' wrath, to Greece the direful spring
Of woes unnumber'd, heavenly goddess, sing!

The souls of mighty chiefs untimely slain;
Whose limbs unburied on the naked shore,
Devouring dogs and hungry vultures tore.
Since great Achilles and Atrides strove,
Such was the sovereign doom, and such the will of Jove!

Declare, O Muse! in what ill-fated hour
Sprung the fierce strife, from what offended power
Latona's son a dire contagion spread,
And heap'd the camp with mountains of the dead;
The king of men his reverent priest defied,
And for the king's offence the people died.

Had kissed me, and the tenderness of rain—
Now you have come, how can I care for kisses

They surged about me singing of the south—
I turned my head away to keep still holy
Your kiss upon my mouth.

And swift sweet rains of shining April weather
Found not my lips where living kisses are;
I bowed my head lest they put out my glory
As rain puts out a star.

Sealed with a seal and safe forevermore—

The Uses of Poetry,"
I've fond anticipation of a day
O'erfilled with pure diversion presently,
For I must read a lady poesy
The while we glide by many a leafy bay,

Hid deep in rushes, where at random play
The glossy black winged May-flies, or whence flee
Hush-throated nestlings in alarm,
Whom we have idly frighted with our boat's long sway.

For, lest o'ersaddened by such woes as spring
To rural peace from our meek onward trend,
What else more fit? We'll draw the latch-string

And close the door of sense; then satiate wend,

The torments it deserves to try,
That tears my fix'd heart from my love.

When, wearied with a world of woe,
To thy safe bosom I retire,
Where love, and peace, and truth does flow,
May I contented there expire!

There are two births; the one when light

The other when two souls unite,

When you loved me and I loved you
Then both of us were born anew.

Love then to us new souls did give

Void and Compensation (Pug-nosed Dream),"
If most things speak for themselves, can't it be said

The first step is all about obsession with exclusion,

with enough fat in their chests to burn down a barn.

Isn't your own heart that way from what or whom you can't have?

And shown no glorious morning face;
If beams from happy human eyes
Have moved me not; if morning skies,
Books, and my food, and summer rain
Knocked on my sullen heart in vain:-
Lord, thy most pointed pleasure take
And stab my spirit broad awake;
Or, Lord, if too obdurate I,
Choose thou, before that spirit die,
A piercing pain, a killing sin,
And to my dead heart run them in!",Robert Louis Stevenson,Poets.Org,15.0,30.53333333333333, This poem is in the public domain.

Nothing was ever what it claimed to be,

The blue beneficence we call and spell
and call blue heaven, the whiteblue well
of constant water, deepening a thee,

Line Poem,"
Long jetty, long shell-racked jetty, cracked warped planks.

Beautiful fish, beautiful sea-bass poached with an August tomato, on an ironstone plate.

A snake's slough, a snake's spinal cord, a dry-rot stump.

A twill tape measure, an audiotape cassette unspooled and puckered, shining.

Agate prayer beads, kazoos, whistles, rattles.

A bike-chain and a bungy cord.  A moebius strip and a broccoli elastic.

Split vanilla pod inset with paltry-looking flat oily brown seeds.

Egg-and-dart molding of vitreous fake sandstone.  Contrails, mares' tails, mackerel sky.",Caroline Knox,Poets.Org,16.0,34.5, From Quaker Guns by Caroline Knox. Copyright © 2008 by Caroline Knox. Used by permission of Wave Books.

Little Gold Canoe,"
A little gold canoe rows across
the Mississippi brown floor.

I call it by its name: ""Cockroach!""

slap and slam it, tear a paper towel,

Restless Ghost,"
The wasp's paper nest hung all winter.
Sun, angled in low and oblique,
Backlit—with cold fever—the dull lantern.

Emptied, the dangled nest drew him:
Gray. Translucent. At times an heirloom
Of glare, paper white as burning ash.

Neither destination nor charm, the nest
Possessed a gravity, lured him, nonetheless,
And he returned to behold the useless globe

Eclipse, wane and wax. He returned,
A restless ghost in a house the wind owns,
And the wind went right through him.",Eric Pankey,Poets.Org,16.0,28.8125, From The Pear as One Example by Eric Pankey. Copyright © 2008 by Eric Pankey. Published by Ausable Press. Used by permission of the publisher. All rights reserved.

Laughing below, the unimagined room
in unimagined mouths, a turning mood

What is a happening but conscious cloud

pellucidity describing term

The torso facing east, the head nearly west,

Nothing for once.

There were the walls of the mind.
There were the cliffs of the mind,

Now that no one looking at the night—
Sky blanked by leakage from electric lamps
And headlights prowling through the parking lot
Could recognize the Babylonian dance

And scales, and swordsmen battling with beasts

Illegibly across an empty space,
Maybe the old unfalsifiable
Predictions and extrapolated spheres
No longer need to be an obstacle

"Jacksonville, Vermont","
Because I am not married, I have the skin of an orange 

that has spent its life in the dark. Inside the orange 
I am blind. I cannot tell when a hand reaches in 

and breaks the atoms of the blood. Sometimes
 
a blackbird will bring the wind into my hair. 
Or the yellow clouds falling on the cold floor are animals 

beginning to fight each other out of their drifting misery. 

All the women I have known have been ruined by fog 
and the deer crossing the field at night. ",Jason Shinder,Poets.Org,15.0,30.866666666666667," Copyright© 2005 by Jason Shinder. First published in The American Poetry Review, November/December 2005.

How I Am,"
When I talk to my friends I pretend I am standing on the wings 

of a flying plane. I cannot be trusted to tell them how I am. 
Or if I am falling to earth weighing less 

than a dozen roses. Sometimes I dream they have broken up 

with their lovers and are carrying food to my house. 
When I open the mailbox I hear their voices 

like the long upward-winding curve of a train whistle 

passing through the tall grasses and ferns 
after the train has passed. I never get ahead of their shadows. 

I embrace them in front of moving cars. I keep them away 

from my miseries because to say I am miserable is to say I am like them. ",Jason Shinder,Poets.Org,19.0,32.31578947368421," Copyright© 2005 by Jason Shinder.

    I think about your sex.
My heart simplified, I think about your sex,
before the ripe daughterloin of day.
I touch the bud of joy, it is in season.
And an ancient sentiment dies
degenerated into brains.

    I think about your sex, furrow more prolific
and harmonious than the belly of the Shadow,
though Death conceives and bears
from God himself.

I am thinking, yes, about the free beast
who takes pleasure where he wants, where he can.

The worm, regret, will canker on,

Which by shadows are exprest:

Instead of hiding there.

Yet there it was content to bloom,
In modest tints arrayed;
And there diffused a sweet perfume,
Within the silent shade.

In sweet humility.",Jane Taylor,Poets.Org,20.0,22.35, This poem is in the public domain.

first they strapped him into the chair,

The Golden Years,"&#13;
All I do these drawn-out days&#13;
is sit in my kitchen at Pheasant Ridge&#13;
where there are no pheasants to be seen&#13;
and last time I looked, no ridge.&#13;
&#13;
I could drive over to Quail Falls&#13;
and spend the day there playing bridge,&#13;
but the lack of a falls and the absence of quail&#13;
would only remind me of Pheasant Ridge.&#13;
&#13;
I know a widow at Fox Run&#13;
and another with a condo at Smokey Ledge.&#13;
One of them smokes, and neither can run,&#13;
so I’ll stick to the pledge I made to Midge.&#13;
&#13;
Who frightened the fox and bulldozed the ledge?&#13;
I ask in my kitchen at Pheasant Ridge.&#13;",Billy Collins,Poets.Org,18.0,34.666666666666664, From Ballistics by Billy Collins. Copyright © 2008 by Billy Collins. Reprinted by arrangement with The Random House Publishing Group. 
Poetry Is a Destructive Force,"
That's what misery is,
Nothing to have at heart. 
It is to have or nothing. 

It is a thing to have, 
A lion, an ox in his breast, 
To feel it breathing there.
 
Corazon, stout dog, 
Young ox, bow-legged bear, 
He tastes its blood, not spit. 

He is like a man 
In the body of a violent beast. 
Its muscles are his own . . .

The lion sleeps in the sun. 
Its nose is on its paws. 
It can kill a man. ",Wallace Stevens,Poets.Org,20.0,19.15," From The Collected Poems of Wallace Stevens by Wallace Stevens. Copyright © 1954 by Wallace Stevens and renewed in 1982 by Holly Stevens.

Requiescat,"
Strew on her roses, roses,   
  And never a spray of yew.   
In quiet she reposes:   
  Ah! would that I did too.   
  
Her mirth the world required:
  She bathed it in smiles of glee.   
But her heart was tired, tired,   
  And now they let her be.   
  
Her life was turning, turning,

But for peace her soul was yearning,

Mercury Dressing,"
To steal a glance and, anxious, see
Him slipping into transparency—
The feathered helmet already in place,
Its shadow fallen across his face

Unsteadies the routines of the heart.
If I reach out and touch his wing,
What harm, what help might he then bring?

But suddenly he disappears,
As so much else has down the years...
Until I feel him deep inside
The emptiness, preoccupied.

"Evening Concert, Sainte-Chapelle","
The celebrated windows flamed with light
directly pouring north across the Seine;
we rustled into place.  Then violins
vaunting Vivaldi's strident strength, then Brahms,
seemed to suck with their passionate sweetness,
bit by bit, the vigor from the red,
the blazing blue, so that the listening eye
saw suddenly the thick black lines, in shapes
of shield and cross and strut and brace, that held
the holy glowing fantasy together.
The music surged; the glow became a milk,
a whisper to the eye, a glimmer ebbed
until our beating hearts, our violins
were cased in thin but solid sheets of lead.

"Summer at Blue Creek, North Carolina","
There was no water at my grandfather's
when I was a kid and would go for it
with two zinc buckets. Down the path,
past the cow by the foundation where
the fine people's house was before
they arranged to have it burned down.
To the neighbor's cool well. Would
come back with pails too heavy,
so my mouth pulled out of shape.
I see myself, but from the outside.

with my tired children,

if the rug beneath us
is woven with tough flowers,

Hawk,"
All eyes are fearful of the spotted hawk,
whose dappled wingspread opens to a phrase
that only victims gaping in the gaze
of Death Occurring can recite. To stalk;
to plunge; to harvest; the denial-squawk
of dying's struggle; these are but a day's 
rebuke to hunger for the hawk, whose glazed
accord with Death admits no show of shock.

Death's users know it is not theirs to own,
nor can they fathom all it means to die—
for young to know a different Death from old.
But when the spotted hawk's last flight is flown,
he too becomes a novice, fear-struck by
the certain plummet once these feathers fold.",Daniel Waters,Poets.Org,16.0,36.8125, From Skunk Night Sonnets by Daniel Waters. Copyright © 2009 by Daniel Waters. Used by permission of Bright Hill Press. All rights reserved.

the street one morning after a storm....

drawn on walls and also lines
drawn across the canvases of the last paintings
of Agnes Martin. One of them has two pale squares
on a blackened field.

		The lines on your walls

Forget pearls, lace-edged kerchiefs, roomy pleats—
this is my most matronly adornment:

upon my fecund, unspeakable dark,
my indecorum needled together
with torquemadan efficiency.  
But O!  the dream of the dropped stitch!  the loophole
through which that unruly within might thread,
catch with a small snag, pull the fray, unknit 
the knots unnoticed, and undoily me.

Children in a Field,"
They don't wade in so much as they are taken.
Deep in the day, in the deep of the field,
every current in the grasses whispers hurry
hurry, every yellow spreads its perfume
like a rumor, impelling them further on.
It is the way of girls.  It is the sway
of their dresses in the summer trance-
light, their bare calves already far-gone
in green.  What songs will they follow?
Whatever the wood warbles, whatever storm
or harm the border promises, whatever
calm.  Let them go.  Let them go traceless

blur, traceless across the lean blue glint

Greeter of Souls,"
Ponds are spring-fed, lakes run off rivers. 
Here souls pass, not one deified, 
and sometimes this is terrible to know 
three floors below the street, where light drinks the world, 
siphoned like music through portals. 
How fed, that dark, the octaves framed faceless. 
A memory of water. 
The trees more beautiful not themselves. 
Souls who have passed here, tired, brightening. 
Dumpsters of linen, empty 
gurneys along corridors to parking garages. 
Who wonders, is it morning? 
Who washes these blankets? 
Can I not be the greeter of souls? 
What's to be done with the envelopes of hair? 
If the inlets are frozen, can I walk across? 
When I look down into myself to see a scattering of birds, 
do I put on the new garments?

Here you must take a boat from one day to the next,

But they are sailing like a pendulum between eternity and evening, 

diving, recovering, balancing the air. 
Who can tell at this hour seabirds from starlings, 

wind from revolving doors or currents off the river.

Shoal of Sharks,"
""Oh, look at all the porpoise!"" someone shouted 
While passengers ran to snap their cameras; 
But what they leaned toward was a shoal of sharks 
Before us, moving like a floating island: 
A seething multitude of tails and fins 
Fleeing the fury of a hurricane 
Hundreds of miles away. They splashed and swarmed. 
Slashing the sea to threads of hissing foam 
Beneath us, tossing bellies to the sun. 
Staring into the blood pits of our eyes 
Ferocious for the flesh and stench of us. 
Lucky for us high on our high-tech ark 
Looking back on life's primeval broth 
At such perpetual and perfect kin.",Richard O'Connell,Poets.Org,15.0,38.93333333333333, First published in National Review. Copyright © 2001 by Richard O'Connell. Used by permission of the author.

Ships That Pass in the Night,"
Out in the sky the great dark clouds are massing;
   I look far out into the pregnant night,
Where I can hear a solemn booming gun
   And catch the gleaming of a random light,
That tells me that the ship I seek is passing, passing.

My tearful eyes my soul's deep hurt are glassing;
   For I would hail and check that ship of ships.
I stretch my hands imploring, cry aloud,
   My voice falls dead a foot from mine own lips,
And but its ghost doth reach that vessel, passing, passing.

O Earth, O Sky, O Ocean, both surpassing,
   O heart of mine, O soul that dreads the dark!
Is there no hope for me? Is there no way
   That I may sight and check that speeding bark

The Debt,"
This is the debt I pay
Just for one riotous day,
Years of regret and grief,

To Dorothy,"
You are not beautiful, exactly.
You are beautiful, inexactly.
You let a weed grow by the mulberry
and a mulberry grow by the house.
So close, in the personal quiet
of a windy night, it brushes the wall
and sweeps away the day till we sleep.

A child said it, and it seemed true:
""Things that are lost are all equal.""
But it isn't true. If I lost you,
the air wouldn't move, nor the tree grow.
Someone would pull the weed, my flower.

On Moving Again,"
This evening, walking along the long field
My eye was drawn to a living shimmer in the sky:
Three aspens alone alive in a world of almost motionless 
Cottonwood and willow and Chinese elm trees.

The breeze that barely stirred the others
Sprang it free, spangling leaves like light on water,
An electric flutter, the secret energy
In the heart of the world revealed.  So free.

An aspen leaf might believe itself inordinately busy
(especially comparatively) and certain therefore
It will expire prematurely, useless, stupid, failed.
From where I stood, it was the most beautiful thing to see.

My life could be similarly pleasing to God.
I guess this could be service enough for me.",Liz Waldner,Poets.Org,18.0,37.05555555555556, Copyright © 2009 by Liz Waldner. Used by permission of the author. All rights reserved.

Ways apt and new to sing of love I'd find,
Forcing from her hard heart full many a sigh,
And re-enkindle in her frozen mind
Desires a thousand, passionate and high;

See her fond eyes at length where pity reigns,
As one who sorrows when too late, alas!
For his own error and another's pains;
See the fresh roses edging that fair snow
Move with her breath, that ivory descried,
Which turns to marble him who sees it near;

Lost,"
A cry was heard among the trees,
not a man's, something deeper.
The forest extended up one side
the mountain and down the other. 
None wanted to ask what had made
the cry. A bird, one wanted to say,
although he knew it wasn't a bird.
The sun climbed to the mountaintop,  
and slid back down the other side.
The black treetops against the sky
were like teeth on a saw. They waited
for it to come a second time. It's lost,
one said. Each thought of being lost
and all the years that stretched behind.
Where had wrong turns been made?
Soon the cry came again. Closer now. ",Stephen Dobyns,Poets.Org,17.0,32.64705882352941, From Winter's Journey by Stephen Dobyns. Copyright © 2010 by Stephen Dobyns. Used by permission of Copper Canyon Press. All rights reserved.

He knows why his players 
lift and curl. He sees them

Away from the markings and evidence

for memory. The delicate hold
and tender rearrangement of what is missing,

Outside the Church,"
The clinic hardly ever called the cops

O dandelion, rich and haughty,
King of village flowers!

Today We Make the Poet&#039;s Words Our Own,"
To-day we make the poet's words our own, 
And utter them in plaintive undertone; 
Nor to the living only be they said, 
But to the other living called the dead, 
Whose dear, paternal images appear 
Not wrapped in gloom, but robed in sunshine here; 
Whose simple lives, complete and without flaw, 
Were part and parcel of great Nature's law; 
Who said not to their Lord, as if afraid, 
""Here is thy talent in a napkin laid,"" 
But labored in their sphere, as men who live 
In the delight that work alone can give. 
Peace be to them; eternal peace and rest, 
And the fulfilment of the great behest: 
""Ye have been faithful over a few things, 
Over ten cities shall ye reign as kings.""",Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,Poets.Org,17.0,39.23529411764706, From Morituri Salutamus: Poem for the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Class of 1825 in Bowdoin College; 1875.

Will hug you close and keep you warm.",Thomas Shadwell,Poets.Org,9.0,31.0, This poem is in the public domain.

Temper,"
Some things are damned to erupt like wildfire,

windblown, like wild lupine, like wings, one after

Peak bloom, a brood of blue before firebrand.

obey. One after another, they breathe in and butterfly

Electricity,"
Children picking through the rocks
beside the river on a spring day.
What are they looking for? Old green
net tangled on broken pilings; a couple
embracing on the tumbledown esplanade.
Some fishermen drinking beer from tall brown bottles. 
Broken shells, tire treads, rusted aluminum pull-tabs—
downriver, near the sun, the great echoes 
and the embers of the bridge; and upriver,
far away, the echoing spools and dynamos 
of the dam, its forces crackling outward 
like the giant snow crab's jointed legs,
like a web in sunlight, a net, a chorus
of embers, like a plan the river is planning,
abstract, afire and electric, glowing
in the levitating rubric, invisible,
visible to children, undiscovered:

Soul-Sight,"
Like moon-dark, like brown water you escape,
O laughing mouth, O sweet uplifted lips.
Within the peering brain old ghosts take shape;
You flame and wither as the white foam slips
Back from the broken wave: sometimes a start,
A gesture of the hands, a way you own
Of bending that smooth head above your heart,—
Then these are vanished, then the dream is gone.

Oh, you are too much mine and flesh of me
To seal upon the brain, who in the blood
Are so intense a pulse, so swift a flood
Of beauty, such unceasing instancy.

Ophelia to the Court,"
My shoes are unpolished, my words smudged.
I come to you undressed (the lord, he whispers
Smut; that man, he whispers such). I bend
My thoughts, I submit, but a bird 
Keeps flying from my mind, it slippers
My feet and sings—barren world, 
I have been a little minx in it, not at all
Domestic, not at all clean, not at all blinking
At my lies. First he thought he had a wife, then 
(of course) he thought he had a whore. All
I wanted (if I may speak for myself) was: more.
If only one of you had said, I hold 
Your craven breaking soul, I see the pieces,
I feel them in my hands, idle silver, idle gold...
You see I cannot speak without telling what I am.

You're sitting at a small bay window
in an empty café by the sea.
It's nightfall, and the owner is locking up,
though you're still hunched over the radiator,
which is slowly losing warmth.

Now you're walking down to the shore
to watch the last blues fading on the waves.
You've lived in small houses, tight spaces—
the walls around you kept closing in—
but the sea and the sky were also yours.

No one else is around to drink with you
from the watery fog, shadowy depths.
You're alone with the whirling cosmos.

Mutability,"
We are as clouds that veil the midnight moon;
  How restlessly they speed, and gleam, and quiver,
Streaking the darkness radiantly!—yet soon
  Night closes round, and they are lost for ever:

Or like forgotten lyres, whose dissonant strings
  Give various response to each varying blast,
To whose frail frame no second motion brings
  One mood or modulation like the last.

We rest.—A dream has power to poison sleep;
  We rise.—One wandering thought pollutes the day;
We feel, conceive or reason, laugh or weep;
  Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away:

It is the same!—For, be it joy or sorrow,
  The path of its departure still is free:
Man's yesterday may ne'er be like his morrow;
  Nought may endure but Mutability.",Percy Bysshe Shelley,Poets.Org,20.0,35.35, `

Fear of the Future,"
In the end one simply withdraws
From others and time, one's own time,
Becoming an imaginary Everyman
Inhabiting a few rooms, personifying

Nothing ever actually happened—a fictitious
Man whose life was over from the start,
Like a diary or a daybook whose poems
And stories told the same story over
And over again, or no story. The pictures
And paintings hang crooked on the walls, 
The limbs beneath the sheets are frail and cold
And morning is an exercise in memory
Of a long failure, and of the years
Mirrored in the face of the immaculate
Child who can't believe he's old.",John Koethe,Poets.Org,19.0,34.94736842105263, From Ninety-fifth Street. Copyright © 2009 by John Koethe. Used with permission of HarperCollins Publishers.

The heavenly things ignite and freeze.
But not as my hair falls before you.
Fragile and momentary, we continue.
Fearing madness in all things huge

Very long ago when the exquisite celadon bowl

no one in Japan had the skill and courage
to mend it. So the pieces were taken back

that it be repaired. When the bowl returned,

It came to him that he could nearly count
How many Octobers he had left to him
In increments of ten or, say, eleven
Thus: sixty-three, seventy-four, eighty-five.
He couldn't see himself at ninety-six—
Humanity's advances notwithstanding
In health-care, self-help, or new-age regimens—
What with his habits and family history,
The end he thought is nearer than you think.

The future, thus confined to its contingencies,
The present moment opens like a gift:

The hour's routine, the minute's passing glance—

Dirty, common, greedy—only birds.

As though we glimpsed them through a torn disguise—

for a decade of accumulated injustices,
all the things you've never said circling inside you.

The rising wind pulls you out of it,

were sighing, Let it go, let it go,

We'd exercise by making love outside,

It was the language that left us first.
The Great Migration of words. When people
spoke they punched each other in the mouth.
There was no vocabulary for love. Women
became masculine and could no longer give
birth to warmth or a simple caress with their
lips. Tongues were overweight from profanity
and the taste of nastiness. It settled over cities
like fog smothering everything in sight. My
ears begged for camouflage and the chance
to go to war. Everywhere was the decay of
how we sound. Someone said it reminded
them of the time Sonny Rollins disappeared.

A Crocodile,"
Hard by the lilied Nile I saw
A duskish river-dragon stretched along,
The brown habergeon of his limbs enamelled
With sanguine almandines and rainy pearl:
And on his back there lay a young one sleeping,
No bigger than a mouse; with eyes like beads,
And a small fragment of its speckled egg
Remaining on its harmless, pulpy snout;
A thing to laugh at, as it gaped to catch
The baulking merry flies. In the iron jaws
Of the great devil-beast, like a pale soul
Fluttering in rocky hell, lightsomely flew
A snowy trochilus, with roseate beak
Tearing the hairy leeches from his throat.",Thomas Lovell Beddoes,Poets.Org,15.0,37.86666666666667, This poem is in the public domain. 
The Hesperides,"Hesperus and his daughters threeThat sing about the golden tree.Comus, Milton

The North-wind fall'n, in the new starréd night
Zidonian Hanno, voyaging beyond
The hoary promontory of Soloë
Past Thymiaterion, in calméd bays,
Between the Southern and the western Horn,
Heard neither warbling of the nightingale,
Nor melody of the Lybian lotus flute
Blown seaward from the shore; but from a slope
That ran bloom-bright into the Atlantic blue,
Beneath a highland leaning down a weight
Of cliffs, and zoned below with cedar shade,
Came voices, like the voices in a dream,
Continuous, till he reached the other sea.","Alfred, Lord Tennyson",Poets.Org,15.0,39.73333333333333, This poem is in the public domain. 
Song from Paracelsus,"
Heap cassia, sandal-buds and stripes
Of labdanum, and aloe-balls,
Smeared with dull nard an Indian wipes
From out her hair: such balsam falls
Down sea-side mountain pedestals,
From tree-tops where tired winds are fain,
Spent with the vast and howling main,
To treasure half their island-gain.

And strew faint sweetness from some old
Egyptian's fine worm-eaten shroud
Which breaks to dust when once unrolled;
Or shredded perfume, like a cloud
From closet long to quiet vowed,
With mothed and dropping arras hung,
Mouldering her lute and books among,
As when a queen, long dead, was young.",Robert Browning,Poets.Org,18.0,31.83333333333333, This poem is in the public domain. 
Terrace,"
A plane tree, leaves green as if polished, 
the reddened tips of fruit trees, a stand
of cypress, and through the blackened green, 
a yellow field, slant of roof. Nearer, 
the castle gate, pale brick flecked with stone
like cream with nutmeg or cinnamon,  
and climbing, vermilion of roses.

As swallows shriek and dive, their shadows
loop to mark the wall, then disappear.",Honor Moore,Poets.Org,11.0,33.18181818181818, Copyright © 2011 by Honor Moore. Used with permission of the author. 
To George Sand: A Recognition,"
True genius, but true woman! dost deny	
Thy woman's nature with a manly scorn	
And break away the gauds and armlets worn	
By weaker women in captivity?	
Ah, vain denial! that revolted cry	        
Is sobbed in by a woman's voice forlorn—	
Thy woman's hair, my sister, all unshorn	
Floats back dishevelled strength in agony	
Disproving thy man's name: and while before	
The world thou burnest in a poet-fire,	        
We see thy woman-heart beat evermore	
Through the large flame. Beat purer, heart, and higher,	
Till God unsex thee on the heavenly shore,	
Where unincarnate spirits purely aspire!",Elizabeth Barrett Browning,Poets.Org,15.0,38.93333333333333, This poem is in the public domain.

Lightning-torn bark lured on the lower limbs, a sym-

The House,"
Sometimes, on waking, she would close her eyes
For a last look at that white house she knew
In sleep alone, and held no title to,
And had not entered yet, for all her sighs.

What did she tell me of that house of hers?
White gatepost; terrace; fanlight of the door;
A widow's walk above the bouldered shore;
Salt winds that ruffle the surrounding firs.

Is she now there, wherever there may be?
Only a foolish man would hope to find
That haven fashioned by her dreaming mind.
Night after night, my love, I put to sea.",Richard Wilbur,Poets.Org,15.0,33.666666666666664, From Anterooms: New Poems and Translation by Richard Wilbur. Copyright © 2010 by Richard Wilbur. Used by permission of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company. All rights reserved. 
My First Roses,"
My first roses brought me to my senses.
All my furies, I launched them like paper boats 
in the algaed pond behind my house. 

First they were pale, then peach and blood red.
You could be merciless trimming them back.
You could be merciless and I needed that.

Emerald green with crimson tips,
these were no crowns of thorns.
They would not portend nor intimate.

But if you fed them they'd branch out:
two generations in a single summer.
One had a scent of fruit & violet, the other

blazed up, a flotilla of lips on the lawn.",Ira Sadoff,Poets.Org,18.0,28.444444444444443, Copyright © 2011 by Ira Sadoff. Used with permission of the author. 
Fairbanks Under the Solstice,"
Slowly, without sun, the day sinks
toward the close of December.
It is minus sixty degrees.

Over the sleeping houses a dense
fog rises—smoke from banked fires,
and the snowy breath of an abyss
through which the cold town
is perceptibly falling.

As if Death were a voice made visible, 
with the power of illumination...

Now, in the white shadow
of those streets, ghostly newsboys
make their rounds, delivering 
to the homes of those
who have died of the frost
word of the resurrection of Silence.",John Haines,Poets.Org,20.0,24.05," Excerpted from The Owl in the Mask of the Dreamer: Collected Poems, copyright © 1993 by John Haines. Used with permission of Graywolf Press. "

Before,"
I always thought death would be like traveling
in a car, moving through the desert,
the earth a little darker than sky at the horizon,
that your life would settle like the end of a day
and you would think of everyone you ever met,
that you would be the invisible passenger,
quiet in the car, moving through the night,
forever, with the beautiful thought of home.",Carl Adamshick,Poets.Org,9.0,39.55555555555556, Copyright © 2011 by Carl Adamshick. Used with permission of the author. 
Mother&#039;s Day,"
 —for my children

I see her doing something simple, paying bills,
or leafing through a magazine or book,
and wish that I could say, and she could hear,

that now I start to understand her love
for all of us, the fullness of it.

It burns there in the past, beyond my reach,

Get Used To It,"
Wake up, even Monday the cup's still full,
lettuce rosette-ing up between sandstone scraps
by back steps where ladybugs swarm in
to die or lay eggs, some say, death-march
or birth-march looking about the same.


The rust of barn-sides: different chemical effect
than rust of oak-copse, burning with late fervor
beyond reaped cornfields.

South,"
In the small towns along the river
nothing happens day after long day.
Summer weeks stalled forever,
and long marriages always the same.
Lives with only emergencies, births,
and fishing for excitement. Then a ship
comes out of the mist. Or comes around
the bend carefully one morning
in the rain, past the pines and shrubs.
Arrives on a hot fragrant night,
grandly, all lit up. Gone two days
later, leaving fury in its wake.

The Libraries Didn&#039;t Burn,"
despite books kindled in electronic flames.

The locket of bookish love
still opens and shuts.

After Us,"
One day someone will fold our blankets
and send them to the cleaners
to scrub the last grain of salt from them,
will open our letters and sort them out by date
instead of by how often they've been read.

One day someone will rearrange the room's furniture
like chessmen at the start of a new game,
will open the old shoebox 
where we hoard pyjama-buttons,
not-quite-dead batteries and hunger.

One day the ache will return to our backs
from the weight of hotel room keys
and the receptionist's suspicion
as he hands over the TV remote control.

Others' pity will set out after us
like the moon after some wandering child.",Nikola Madzirov,Poets.Org,20.0,30.2, Copyright © 2011 by Nikola Madzirov. Reprinted from Remnants from Another Age with the permission of BOA Editions. 
Egg,"
When you kill it at the edge of the pan, you don't notice
That the egg grows an eye in death.

It is so small, it doesn't satisfy
Even the most modest morning appetite.

But it already watches, already stares at your world.
What are its horizons, whose glassy-eyed perspectives?

Does it see time, which moves carelessly through space?
Eyeballs, eyeballs, cracked shells, chaos or order?

Big questions for such a little eye at such an early hour.  
And you – do you really want an answer?

When you sit down, eye to eye, behind a table,
You blind it soon enough with a crust of bread.

Recession,"
A grotesquerie for so long we all ignored it:
The mammoth plastic Santa lighting up
On the Quik-Stop's roof, presiding over pumps
That gleamed and gushed in the tarmac lot below it.
 
Out back, with pumps of their own, the muttering diesels.
And we, for the most part ordinary folks,
Took all for granted: the idling semis' smoke,
The fuel that streamed into our tanks, above all

Our livelihoods. We stepped indoors to talk
With friends, shared coffee, read the local paper,
Heavy with news of hard times now. We shiver.

The Land of Nod,"
From Breakfast on through all the day
At home among my friends I stay,
But every night I go abroad
Afar into the land of Nod.

All by myself I have to go,
With none to tell me what to do--

And up the mountain-sides of dreams.

The strangest things are there for me,
Both things to eat and things to see,
And many frightening sights abroad
Till morning in the land of Nod.

Country Fair,"
If you didn't see the six-legged dog,
It doesn't matter.
We did, and he mostly lay in the corner.
As for the extra legs,

One got used to them quickly
And thought of other things.
Like, what a cold, dark night
To be out at the fair.

Then the keeper threw a stick
And the dog went after it
On four legs, the other two flapping behind,
Which made one girl shriek with laughter.

"Honky Tonk in Cleveland, Ohio","
It's a jazz affair, drum crashes and cornet razzes.
The trombone pony neighs and the tuba jackass snorts.
The banjo tickles and titters too awful.
The chippies talk about the funnies in the papers.
     The cartoonists weep in their beer.
     Ship riveters talk with their feet
     To the feet of floozies under the tables.
A quartet of white hopes mourn with interspersed snickers:
        ""I got the blues.
        I got the blues.
        I got the blues.""
And . . . as we said earlier:
     The cartoonists weep in their beer.

Road Tar,"
A kid said you could chew road tar
if you got it before it cooled,
black globule with a just-forming skin.
He said it was better than cigarettes.
He said he had a taste for it.

On the same road, a squirrel
was doing the Watusi to free itself
from its crushed hindquarters.
A man on a bicycle stomped on its head,
then wiped his shoe on the grass.

It was autumn, the adult word for fall.
In school we saw a film called Reproduction.
The little snake-father poked his head
into the slippery future,
and a girl with a burned tongue was conceived.",Chase Twichell,Poets.Org,18.0,29.444444444444443," From The Snow Watcher, published by Ontario Review Press, 1998. Copyright © 1998 by Chase Twichell. All rights reserved. Used with permission. "
Stirred Up By Rain,"
I fired up the mower
although it was about to rain--
a chill late September afternoon,
wild flowers re-seeding themselves
in the blue smoke of the gas-oil mix.

To be attached to things is illusion,
yet I'm attached to things.
Cold, clouds, wind, color--the sky
is what the brush-cutter wants to cut,
but again the sky is spared.

One of two things can happen:
either the noisy machine dissolves in the dusk
and the dusk takes refuge in the steady rain,
or the meadow wakes shorn of its flowers.

To the Reader: Polaroids,"
Who are you, austere little cloud
drawn to this page, this sky in the dream
I'm having of meeting you here?

There should be a word that means ""tiny sky.""

A verbal Polaroid of a Polaroid.

But you're the sky, not a cloud.
I'm the cloud. I gather and dissipate,
but you are always here.

I want you with me, and yet you are the end

who? Who did you imagine?
Surely we're not here alone, you and I.

I've been wandering
where the cold tracks of language
collapse into cinders, unburnable trash.
Beyond that, all I can see is the remote cold
of meteors before their avalanches of farewell.

caught in its hangman's-knot of sinking lines,

Shooting Rats at the Bibb County Dump,"
Loaded on beer and whiskey, we ride 
to the dump in carloads
to turn our headlights across the wasted field, 
freeze the startled eyes of rats against mounds of rubbish.

Shot in the head, they jump only once, lie still 
like dead beer cans.
Shot in the gut or rump, they writhe and try to burrow 
into garbage, hide in old truck tires, 
rusty oil drums, cardboard boxes scattered across the mounds,
or else drag themselves on forelegs across our beams of light

Sexism,"
The happiest moment in a woman's life
Is when she hears the turn of her lover's key
In the lock, and pretends to be asleep
When he enters the room, trying to be
Quiet but clumsy, bumping into things,
And she can smell the liquor on his breath
But forgives him because she has him back
And doesn't have to sleep alone.

The happiest moment in a man's life
Is when he climbs out of bed
With a woman, after an hour's sleep,
After making love, and pulls on
His trousers, and walks outside,
And pees in the bushes, and sees
The high August sky full of stars
And gets in his car and drives home.",David Lehman,Poets.Org,18.0,31.88888888888889," From Valentine Place, published by Scribner. Copyright © 1996 by David Lehman. All rights reserved. Reprinted by permission of the author. "

Solaced the parched ones stretched in pain

Was one I know you never do.

Descriptions of Heaven and Hell,"
The wave breaks
And I'm carried into it.
This is hell, I know,
Yet my father laughs,
Chest-deep, proving I'm wrong.
We're safely rooted,
Rocked on his toes.

Nothing irked him more
Than asking, ""What is there
Beyond death?""

That love greets you,
And the loveless
Don't know what to say.",Mark Jarman,Poets.Org,16.0,18.3125," From The Rote Walker, published by Carnegie-Mellon University Press, 1981. Copyright © 1981 by Mark Jarman. All rights reserved. Used with permission. "
Purgatory,"
And suppose the darlings get to Mantua, 
suppose they cheat the crypt, what next? Begin 
with him, unshaven. Though not, I grant you, a 
displeasing cockerel, there's egg yolk on his chin. 
His seedy robe's aflap, he's got the rheum. 
Poor dear, the cooking lard has smoked her eye. 
Another Montague is in the womb 
although the first babe's bottom's not yet dry. 
She scrolls a weekly letter to her Nurse 
who dares to send a smock through Balthasar, 
and once a month, his father posts a purse.

My Father&#039;s Geography,"
I was parading the Côte d'Azur,
hopping the short trains from Nice to Cannes,
following the maze of streets in Monte Carlo
to the hill that overlooks the ville.
A woman fed me pâté in the afternoon,
calling from her stall to offer me more.
At breakfast I talked in French with an old man
about what he loved about America--the Kennedys.

On the beaches I walked and watched
topless women sunbathe and swim,
loving both home and being so far from it.

At a phone looking to Africa over the Mediterranean,
I called my father, and, missing me, he said,

And round it was, upon a hill.
It made the slovenly wilderness
Surround that hill.

Stories said it was a mark left by the hand
of Night, that old she, easily weaving
the universe out of milky strings of chaos.

Tonight what she had was greasy water
whirling in the bottom of her sink, revolution,
and one clean cup.

Raise me above the dwelling-place of men,

I wake and feel the fell of dark, not day.
What hours, O what black hours we have spent
This night! what sights you, heart, saw; ways you went!
And more must, in yet longer light's delay.

With witness I speak this. But where I say
Hours I mean years, mean life. And my lament
Is cries countless, cries like dead letters sent
To dearest him that lives alas! away.

I am gall, I am heartburn. God's most deep decree
Bitter would have me taste: my taste was me;
Bones built in me, flesh filled, blood brimmed the curse.

Selfyeast of spirit a dull dough sours. I see 
The lost are like this, and their scourge to be
As I am mine, their sweating selves, but worse.

His father cast light line out over
The willows.  He's forgotten his

Rolls, and the sky could be, if it

The backdrop of all attention.

He wades out to join the father,
Following where the good strikes
Seem to lead.  It's cold.  The shape

their noodle necks & they shake
like long eyelashes in a hurricane.

takes me to the tin toolshed.
Again she shows me the world

Of Salvadore the Celery King I sing. 
Illiterate in Lewiston, he'd wander,

But when it came to celery, he was king. 
And when he died, the Idaho Daily Sun 
said: Salvadore the Celery King Moves On.

It is 1974 and out the institutional open windows 
of the college dorm, nylon bikinis in floral prints 
are plummeting like the cheap bodies of birds. And then

your mother's large white briefs like a mainsail, like 
a flag of surrender, begin a slow dancing down current, 
cinematic, lithe. All of the faces
are turning up, hushed, like those
holding a hoop to save a child burning. It is the opposite

of being lifted into the sky
the way I imagined my grandfather ascending 
after the long pain of illness: this large pair of underpants 
falling forever on the startled face
of an undergraduate boy.

the joints, the weight of each side straining them.

On First Looking into Chapman&#039;s Homer,"
Much have I traveled in the realms of gold
    And many goodly states and kingdoms seen;
    Round many western islands have I been
Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold.
Oft of one wide expanse had I been told
    That deep-browed Homer ruled as his demesne;
    Yet never did I breathe its pure serene
Till I heard Chapman speak out loud and bold:
Then felt I like some watcher of the skies
    When a new planet swims into his ken;
Or like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes
    He stared at the Pacific—and all his men
Looked at each other with a wild surmise—

    And the soul wears out the breast,
And the heart must pause to breathe,

Concord Hymn,"
By the rude bridge that arched the flood,
    Their flag to April’s breeze unfurled,
Here once the embattled farmers stood,
    And fired the shot heard round the world.

The foe long since in silence slept;
    Alike the conqueror silent sleeps;
And Time the ruined bridge has swept
    Down the dark stream which seaward creeps.

On this green bank, by this soft stream,
    We set to-day a votive stone;
That memory may their deed redeem,
    When, like our sires, our sons are gone.

Spirit, that made those heroes dare
    To die, and leave their children free,

Doth aske a drinke divine:
But might I of Jove's Nectar sup,

Shaken out dead from tree and hill:

I sat now, for the wind was still.

Between my knees my forehead was,--
My lips, drawn in, said not Alas!
My hair was over in the grass,
My naked ears heard the day pass.

My eyes, wide open, had the run
Of some ten weeds to fix upon;

The woodspurge flowered, three cups in one.

O heart, how fares it with thee now,

    Who scarcely darest to inquire,
""What is it makes me beat so low?""

Something it is which thou hast lost,
    Some pleasure from thine early years.
    Break thou deep vase of chilling tears,

Ants and Sharks,"
For A. B.


An ant devours a larva, in accord
with nature, and a child then eats the ant —
it burns on the tongue. Curiosity
always burns. On Paradise Beach in Goa,

a shark will eat the child, but when God sees,
he'll catch the shark, just as he grabs a rat,
a tigress, elephant. The poet in his room
will then eat God. He'll feed on everything.
He is a monster like a boar that bloats,
excretes. He feeds on paper. If you let
him in, he'll find your dreams, love's traces on
the sheets — he'll steal what's holy, masticate,

grow pasty flesh, poisonous fur. It's enough
to touch him or brush by on accident.",Tomasz Rózycki,Poets.Org,20.0,29.6," From The Literary Review (Fall, 2008). Copyright © 2008 by Mira Rosenthal. Used by permission. "

her brother's hand surprising itself

along the map of her neck. Her eyes were shut.
I open mine wide, lean closer.

I form my mouth into an 0, press my lips

a horse in a stall spooked by guttering candles, 
the popping and black smoke, the quivering flanks.

And if a horse, in its loneliness, couldn't manage 
to speak, what difference did it make? 
What could he say? Tell a flickering candle Burn true?

in a circle around her.

no match for the mindless chill that's settled in,

Bone,"
It was first dark when the plow turned it up. 
Unsown, it came fleshless, mud-ruddled, nothing 
but itself, the tendon's bored eye threading
a ponderous needle. And yet the pocked fist 
of one end dared what was undone 
in the strewing, defied the mouth of the hound 
that dropped it.
            The whippoorwill began 
again its dusk-borne mourning. I had never 
seen what urgent wing disembodied 
the voice, would fail to recognize its broken 
shell or shadow or its feathers strewn

my back on my family. May they forgive 
this westward spree, my losing my head

to the shrub-covered bluffs of coastal scrub

may they not worry that I see signs

What My Friend Says When She Gives Me a Persimmon,"
It tastes like your first kiss,

until you almost think it's too late,
the beautiful bright body spoiled.
That's when it's best, that's when you open up
the flesh, that's when you want to 
lay it on your tongue and savor it,
not really like your first kiss but more like 
oral sex, though I wouldn't say that
in public. I couldn't eat one

private hunger going on.",Melody Lacina,Poets.Org,13.0,31.692307692307693," From Private Hunger, The University of Akron Press, copyright © 2002 by Melody Lacina. Reprinted by permission of the University of Akron Press. All rights reserved. "
Wave,"
Tell the truth: no key appeared in your mouth, 
no sound like mum, which wouldn't help anyway. 
Give me a word to get through the night. 
Something spontaneous, fluid:

fireworks dissolving into the black sky--

      Try now. Ripple. Yes.
Put the two of us in a boat on the gray river;
keep rowing in a circle while on the hazy banks

Earth Tremors Felt in Missouri,"
The quake last night was nothing personal, 
you told me this morning. I think one always wonders, 
unless, of course, something is visible: tremors 
that take us, private and willy-nilly, are usual.

But the earth said last night that what I feel, 
you feel; what secretly moves you, moves me. 
One small, sensuous catastrophe 
makes inklings letters, spelled in a worldly tremble.

The earth, with others on it, turns in its course

mindless, more than we were. Pebbles, we swell

Springing,"
In a skiff on a sunrisen lake we are watchers.

Swimming aimlessly is luxury just as walking 
loudly up a shallow stream is.

As we lean over the deep well, we whisper.

Friends at hearths are drawn to the one warm air; 
strangers meet on beaches drawn to the one wet sea.

What wd it be to be water, one body of water 
(what water is is another mystery) (We are 
water divided.) It wd be a self without walls, 
with surface tension, specific gravity a local

rising to fall, falling to rise.

Skylab,"
We've come so far, thought the astronaut
as he swam around the capsule in his third week
and by accident kicked a god in the eye
—so far
that there's no difference anymore between up and down,
north and south, heavy and light.
And how, then, can we know righteousness.

So far. 
And weightless, in a sealed room
we chase the sunrises at high speed
and sicken with longing for a green stalk
or the heft of something in our hands. Lifting a stone.

that looked at him as gravely as the eye of a child

June Light,"
Your voice, with clear location of June days,
Called me outside the window.  You were there,
Light yet composed, as in the just soft stare
Of uncontested summer all things raise
Plainly their seeming into seamless air.

Then your love looked as simple and entire
As that picked pear you tossed me, and your face
As legible as pearskin's fleck and trace,
Which promise always wine, by mottled fire
More fatal fleshed than ever human grace.

And your gay gift—Oh when I saw it fall
Into my hands, through all that naïve light,
It seemed as blessed with truth and new delight
As must have been the first great gift of all.",Richard Wilbur,Poets.Org,17.0,35.588235294117645,None

An old architect at a littered worktable
     sits through morning, eyes fixed on ocean,
intent through evening at the study window,
     motionless though his hand rebuilds years.

Down razory defiles to the rockledge landing

and through soft lolling labia of the waves
     tiny boats coming in, setting out.
   
Priest and corpsedresser begin the climb to his house,
     their empty craft nibbles at spindrift.
A bridegroom and his man steer for the islands,
     plinky music unrolls with their wake.

"Muse, a Lady Cautioning","for Billie Holiday

There's fairness in changing blood for septet's
guardian rhythm, the horn blossoming
into cadenza. No good pimp's scowl, his
baby's voice ruined sweet for the duration.

Yes, these predictable fifths. O, the blues
is all about slinging those low tales out
the back door (sing: child pried open on that
stained floor). O, Billie hollers way down dirt

roads (sing: woman on the verge of needled
logic). She's aware--yeah, I'm going to
kiss some man's sugared fist tonight. O, this

Speech Alone,"
It happens that one pronounces 
a few words just for oneself
alone on this strange earth
then the small white flower
the pebble like all those that went before
the sprig of stubble

blaze in a sun of glory.",Jean Follain,Poets.Org,13.0,25.23076923076923," From Transparence of the World by Jean Follain, translated by W. S. Merwin. Translation copyright © 2003 by W. S. Merwin. Reprinted by permission of Copper Canyon Press. All right reserved. "
Unfinished Poem,"
We live on a holy mountain
where the crows and the Crown Plaza
rise higher than our expectations
and the golden dome is only
a restored reflection 
of the absolute.
All night the bodies of prophets 
break out of the clouds
calling, ""Doom, doom.""
Like the carp we bring home 
from the market, our lives 
are wrapped up in newsprint.
My friend says she'd like to
cut off her head and let all

The Mower at the VA Hospital,"
I
Our mower is young and broad-shouldered:
so were we. Love confuses him as it once did us;
the pain he feels he believes to be genuine.
He even believes it to be pain.
The tiny pink man from Verdun has shit his bed,
the handless man scratches his face like a housecat,
the mower mows and our grief is where it was.

II
We remember some things, but nothing
so exact as form or color or disposition.
All day the wards are dark, while night wears
paper shoes and speaks in insect languages.
Its milky light is sticky and inescapable;
it seals us up. Death is also a mower,
but our mower doesn't know a thing about death.",John Surowiecki,Poets.Org,18.0,33.5, From Watching Cartoons Before Attending a Funeral by John Surowiecki. Copyright © 2003 by John Surowiecki. Reprinted by permission of White Pine Press. All rights reserved.

Remember,"
Remember me when I am gone away,
   Gone far away into the silent land;
   When you can no more hold me by the hand,
Nor I half turn to go yet turning stay.
Remember me when no more day by day
   You tell me of our future that you planned:
   Only remember me; you understand
It will be late to counsel then or pray.
Yet if you should forget me for a while
   And afterwards remember, do not grieve:
   For if the darkness and corruption leave
   A vestige of the thoughts that once I had,
Better by far you should forget and smile
   Than that you should remember and be sad.",Christina Rossetti,Poets.Org,15.0,37.6, This poem is in the public domain. 
Spellbound,"
The night is darkening round me,
The wild winds coldly blow;
But a tyrant spell has bound me

And yet I cannot go.

Wastes beyond wastes below;

Gold,"
Pale gold of the walls, gold
of the centers of daisies, yellow roses
pressing from a clear bowl. All day
we lay on the bed, my hand
stroking the deep
gold of your thighs and your back.
We slept and woke
entering the golden room together,
lay down in it breathing 
quickly, then
slowly again,
caressing and dozing, your hand sleepily
touching my hair now.

We made in those days
tiny identical rooms inside our bodies
which the men who uncover our graves 
will find in a thousand years,
shining and whole.",Donald Hall,Poets.Org,20.0,24.35," From Old and New Poems by Donald Hall, published by Ticknor &amp; Fields. Copyright © 1990 by Donald Hall. Reprinted by permission of Houghton Mifflin Company. All rights reserved. "
Naming,"
Let me tell you this once
(I will not be able to say it again):
I have lost the meaning of words.
Heavy, they ripped away from the sounds,
fell into cracked ground. For weeks
I scratched but what I dug up was
bicycle spokes, black melon rinds,
a smashed doll face--it was not meaning.
I don't know what I am saying.

I exaggerate. Not everything is gone.
I still know perfectly what sugar means,
and pine needle. Laughter is more
of a problem. And yellow often slides,
a plate of butter in the sun.
The meaning of flower has gone entirely;
so has the meaning of love. Now it is safe
to say: I love you. Now it is true.",Nancy Mairs,Poets.Org,19.0,31.68421052631579, This poem is reprinted with the permission of Confluence Press from In All the Rooms of the Yellow House. Copyright © 1984 by Nancy Mairs. All rights reserved. 
"Central Park, Carousel","
June already, it's your birth month,
nine months since the towers fell.
I set olive twigs in my hair
torn from a tree in Central Park,
I ride a painted horse, its mane a sullen wonder.
You are behind me on a lilting mare.
You whisper--What of happiness?
Dukham, Federico. Smoke fills my eyes.

short fires and stubble on a monsoon coast.

Inside the Stove,"
Inside the stove, he found 
a passageway, leading to a set of stairs.
This caused him a great deal of worry
as well as elation and gladness of living.
He did not, however, venture
into the oven, but sent his little brother in
in his stead. This seemed at first 
a good idea, but when the brother
had been gone three days, he began 
to second-guess the wisdom
of his rash choice. He'd go in after him,
he decided. But the passage
had shrunk by then, and no normal-sized
person could fit through. Yes, that's it,
I sent him in because, from a purely physical
standpoint, I myself could never have gone.
And besides, he mumbled to himself,
it's probably nice in there.",Jesse Ball,Poets.Org,19.0,34.1578947368421, From March Book by Jesse Ball. Copyright © 2004 by Jesse Ball. Reprinted by permission of Grove Press. All rights reserved. 
The Path,"
There is so little to go on: a pale
trembling hand as I stand over you,
my finger tracing the words on the page,

for a journey without me. You will do
fine, I say. You will wrap your tongue
around these sounds and be understood,
be given what you desire: a loaf of bread,
change for your money, an antique doll
with violent eyes. Paintings are hanging
on walls, behind glass, waiting for you
to admire them. Their plaintive beauty
will move through you and you will walk
back to your hotel through the park

Sky,"
He broke up the sky on the square and gave it like bread crumbs to birds.
Then he cut it in pieces and threw it to the beggars,
the crazies, the blind, and their companions.
But I got an end, smashed like a cup thrown to the ground,

lying on its back like a wounded soldier,
uncomplaining, as a harem wife
hiding her gaze behind a black veil.
The plains' bed is spread with houses, and everyone

beneath it ages like a slave chained in bondage; 
save his high-cheek-boned face.
Tensing my voice I started to refuse my free portion.

We hold it against you that you survived.
People better than you are dead,

or vanished after school
or stepped off the ledge in despair.

Outside,"
The dead thing mashed into the street
the crows are squabbling over isn't
her, nor are their raucous squawks
the quiet cawing from her throat
those final hours she couldn't speak.
But the racket irks him.
It seems a cruel intrusion into grief
so mute it will never be expressed
no matter how loud or long the wailing
he might do. Nor could there be a word
that won't debase it, no matter
how kind or who it comes from.
She knew how much he loved her.
That must be his consolation
when he must talk to buy necessities.
Every place will be a place without her.

pushing a shopping cart or fetching mail
is just a neatly dressed polite old man. ",Michael Ryan,Poets.Org,20.0,33.15, From New and Selected Poems by Michael Ryan. Copyright © 2004 by Michael Ryan. Reprinted by permission of Houghton Mifflin. All rights reserved.

A tee-shirt for cursory inspection;

a bridge that leaps from her hot red hands

over the swaying nettles, the ragweed,
the clay slope down to the creek,

Parowan Canyon,"
When granite and sandstone begin to blur
and flow, the eye rests on cool white aspen.
Strange, their seeming transparency.
How as in a sudden flash one remembers
a forgotten name, so the recollection. Aspen.
With a breeze in them, their quiet rhythms,
shimmering, quaking. Powder on the palm.
Cool on the cheek. Such delicacy
the brittle wood, limbs snapping
at a grasp, whole trees tumbling in the winds.
Sweet scent on a swollen afternoon.
Autumn, leaves falling one upon another, gold
rains upon a golden earth. How at evening
when the forest darkens, aspen do not.
And a white moon rises and silver stars
point toward the mountain, darkness
holds them so pale.
They stand still, very still.

The Cabbage,"
You have rented an apartment.
You come to this enclosure with physical relief,
your heavy body climbing the stairs in the dark,
the hall bulb burned out, the landlord 
of Greek extraction and possibly a fatalist.
In the apartment leaning against one wall,
your daughter's painting of a large frilled cabbage
against a dark sky with pinpoints of stars.
The eager vegetable, opening itself 
as if to eat the air, or speak in cabbage
language of the meanings within meanings;
while the points of stars hide their massive
violence in the dark upper half of the painting.
You can live with this.

"At Lumen-Empty Monastery, Visiting the Hermitage of Master Jung, My Departed Friend","
The blue-lotus roof standing beside a pond,
White-Horse Creek tumbling through forests,

and my old friend some strange thing now.
A lingering visitor, alone and grief-stricken

after graveside rites among pines, I return, 
Looking for your sitting-mat spread on rock.

Bamboo that seems always my own thoughts:
It keeps fluttering here at your thatch hut.

Quandary,"
All night I flew the dark recess of God's mind.
It was arranged like Iowa fields--

not a damn thing missing.
You ask how I survived.

I lived on a message, broad light
at the end of the world.

Words, they have so much in common with departure,

the clouds elliptical & nervous.
Why translate? It's just a revolving door.

Once there was a shock

One can still go slowly on skis in the winter sun

The Cross of Snow,"
In the long, sleepless watches of the night,
A gentle face--the face of one long dead--
Looks at me from the wall, where round its head
The night-lamp casts a halo of pale light.
Here in this room she died, and soul more white
Never through martyrdom of fire was led
To its repose; nor can in books be read
The legend of a life more benedight.
There is a mountain in the distant West
That, sun-defying, in its deep ravines
Displays a cross of snow upon its side.
Such is the cross I wear upon my breast
These eighteen years, through all the changing scenes
And seasons, changeless since the day she died.",Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,Poets.Org,15.0,39.46666666666667, This poem is in the public domain.

But our marriage is dead, when the pleasure is fled:

With pictures full, of wax and of wool;
Their livers I stick, with needles quick;
There lacks but the blood, to make up the flood.

Vertical push-ups on a sunny wall;
Bees grapple spikes of lavender, or swarm
The dill's gold umbels and low clumps of thyme.
Bored with its trellis, a resourceful rose
Has found a nearby cedar tree to climb
And to festoon with floral furbelows.

Though the great, heat-stunned sunflower looks half-dead
The way it, shepherd's crook-like, hangs its head,
The herbs maintain their modest self-command:

Our lady of strange dreams, and from an urn

Took many shapes, and one cried: ""I am shame 
That walks with Love, I am most wise to turn 
Cold lips and limbs to fire; therefore discern 
And see my loveliness, and praise my name."" 

And afterwords, in radiant garments dressed 
With sound of flutes and laughing of glad lips, 
A pomp of all the passions passed along

Of dawn sailed in. Whereat I said this song,

Nor rays of promise cheats the pensive gloom.

That but itself and darkness nought doth show,
It is my love's being yet it cannot die,

Though vows be false, and faith itself deny,
Though sharp enjoyment be a suicide,

Love in a Life,"
Room after room,
I hunt the house through
We inhabit together.
Heart, fear nothing, for, heart, thou shalt find her,
Next time, herself!—not the trouble behind her
Left in the curtain, the couch's perfume!
As she brushed it, the cornice-wreath blossomed anew,— 
Yon looking-glass gleamed at the wave of her feather.

Yet the day wears,
And door succeeds door;
I try the fresh fortune— 
Range the wide house from the wing to the centre.
Still the same chance! she goes out as I enter.
Spend my whole day in the quest,—who cares?
But 'tis twilight, you see,—with such suites to explore,
Such closets to search, such alcoves to importune!

The First Marriage,"
for Gretchen and Herb: June 15, 1991


imagine the very first marriage a girl
and boy trembling with some inchoate
need for ceremony a desire for witness:
inventing formality like a wheel or a hoe

in a lost language in a clearing too far from here
a prophet or a prophetess intoned to the lovers
who knelt with their hearts cresting
like the unnamed ocean thinking This is true

thinking they will never be alone again
though planets slip their tracks and fish
desert the sea repeating those magic sounds
meaning I do on this stone below
this tree before these friends yes in body
and word my darkdream my sunsong yes I do I do",Peter Meinke,Poets.Org,20.0,30.55, Copyright © 1996 by Peter Meinke. From Scars by Peter Meinke. Reprinted by permission of the University of Pittsburgh Press.

White in the moon the long road lies,  
  The moon stands blank above;  
White in the moon the long road lies  
  That leads me from my love.  
  
Still hangs the hedge without a gust,
  Still, still the shadows stay:  
My feet upon the moonlit dust  
  Pursue the ceaseless way.  
  
The world is round, so travellers tell,  
  And straight though reach the track,  
Trudge on, trudge on, ’twill all be well,

Atlantis—A Lost Sonnet,"

Surely a great city must have been missed?

white pepper, white pudding, you and I meeting 
under fanlights and low skies to go home in it. Maybe 
what really happened is 

this: the old fable-makers searched hard for a word

Mother,"
What you do with time
is what a grandmother clock
does with it: strike twelve
and take its time doing it.
You’re the clock: time passes,
you remain. And wait.

Waiting is what happens to
a snow-covered garden, 
a trunk under moss,
hope for better times
in the nineteenth century,

grow moldy together, like grapes
turning into wine, reality into preserves,

in the cellar of yourself. ",Herman de Coninck,Poets.Org,20.0,22.05," From The Plural of Happiness: Selected Poems of Herman de Coninck, translated by Laure-Anne Bosselaar and Kurt Brown, Oberlin College Press, © 2006. Reprinted with permission of Oberlin College Press. "

So my first book was always big

a quilt rack
Magazines face out from the wall

Psalm,"
for the flutes


Trust the flutes in their lament between a woman and a man
Whatever they say sounds like laughing 
Reveling in heavenly dilemmas
In harmony in mint in phallic moonlight a cunt sun
Whatever the others say wandering away never believe it

Her kisses monotonous whether animals commandments
Whatever way you turn sounds like arguing

Jealousy.  Whispered weather reports.
The lure of the land so strong it prompts

Now sand under sand hides
the buried world, the one in which our fathers failed,
the palm frond a dangerous truth
they once believed, and touched.  Bloodied their hands.

You who are more than mother unto me,
And fill my heart of hearts, where Death installed you
In setting my Virginia's spirit free.
My mother—my own mother, who died early,
Was but the mother of myself; but you
Are mother to the one I loved so dearly,

With silver spurs and silken plumes a-blow,
And flashing sword caught fast and buckled back

And spoke in voice meticulously low.
He came and Romance followed in his track...

I did not ask his name—I thought him Love;
I did not care to see his hidden face.

All thought seemed flown like some forgotten dove.

Azaleas and the scent of them,
And honeysuckles in the night.

Or Negroes humming melodies.

Are sudden tear-drops in your eyes.",Gwendolyn Bennett,Poets.Org,15.0,29.8, This poem is in the public domain.

Of Many Worlds in This World,"
Just like as in a nest of boxes round,
Degrees of sizes in each box are found:
So, in this world, may many others be
Thinner and less, and less still by degree:

A world may be no bigger than two-pence.
Nature is curious, and such works may shape,
Which our dull senses easily escape:
For creatures, small as atoms, may there be,
If every one a creature’s figure bear.
If atoms four, a world can make, then see
What several worlds might in an ear-ring be:

The Uses of Poetry,"
I've fond anticipation of a day
O'erfilled with pure diversion presently,
For I must read a lady poesy
The while we glide by many a leafy bay,

Hid deep in rushes, where at random play
The glossy black winged May-flies, or whence flee
Hush-throated nestlings in alarm,
Whom we have idly frighted with our boat's long sway.

For, lest o'ersaddened by such woes as spring
To rural peace from our meek onward trend,

The torments it deserves to try,

Then both of us were born anew.

Love then to us new souls did give
   And in those souls did plant new powers;
Since when another life we live,
   The breath we breathe is his, not ours:
Love makes those young whom age doth chill,
And whom he finds young keeps young still.",William Cartwright,Poets.Org,14.0,32.42857142857143, This poem is in the public domain. 
The Fist,"
The fist clenched round my heart
loosens a little, and I gasp
brightness; but it tightens
again. When have I ever not loved
the pain of love? But this has moved

past love to mania. This has the strong
clench of the madman, this is
gripping the ledge of unreason, before
plunging howling into the abyss.

Hold hard then, heart. This way at least you live.",Derek Walcott,Poets.Org,13.0,26.53846153846154," ""The Fist"" from Collected Poems: 1948-1984 by Derek Walcott. Copyright © 1986 by Derek Walcott. Reprinted by permission of Farrar, Straus and Giroux, LLC. "
The Hand,"
The teacher asks a question.
You know the answer, you suspect
you are the only one in the classroom 
who knows the answer, because the person
in question is yourself, and on that 
you are the greatest living authority,
but you don’t raise your hand.
You raise the top of your desk
and take out an apple.
You look out the window.
You don’t raise your hand and there is
some essential beauty in your fingers,
which aren’t even drumming, but lie 
flat and peaceful.
The teacher repeats the question. 
Outside the window, on an overhanging branch,
a robin is ruffling its feathers
and spring is in the air.",Mary Ruefle,Poets.Org,19.0,30.84210526315789, Reprinted from Cold Pluto by permission of Carnegie Mellon University Press. Copyright © 1996 by Mary Ruefle. 
Sonnet 100,"
In night when colors all to black are cast,
Distinction lost, or gone down with the light;
The eye a watch to inward senses placed,
Not seeing, yet still having powers of sight,

Gives vain alarums to the inward sense,
Where fear stirred up with witty tyranny,
Confounds all powers, and thorough self-offense,
Doth forge and raise impossibility:

Such as in thick depriving darknesses,
Proper reflections of the error be,
And images of self-confusednesses,
Which hurt imaginations only see;

And from this nothing seen, tells news of devils,
Which but expressions be of inward evils.",Lord Brooke Fulke Greville,Poets.Org,18.0,31.55555555555556, This poem is in the public domain.

A peels an apple, while B kneels to God,
C telephones to D, who has a hand

While K brings down a nightstick on L’s head,
And M takes mustard, N drives to town,
O goes to bed with P, and Q drops dead, 
R lies to S, but happens to be heard

Void and Compensation (Pug-nosed Dream),"
If most things speak for themselves, can't it be said
that really you're doing the thinking for them? 

The first step is all about obsession with exclusion, 
the cold front coming in and forcing you to hunker down,
the migrants winging their way to some gold coast
with enough fat in their chests to burn down a barn.

Isn't your own heart that way from what or whom you can't have? 
Wasn't Sarah Vaughn singing this all along? 

Polka dots and moonbeams, for sure, and that dress
that loves your body suddenly put aside, and that touch,
oh brick wall, oh tin car, oh small space
inside the crumple zone of either/or. ",Michael Morse,Poets.Org,16.0,37.875, Copyright © 2006 by Michael Morse. First published in Spinning Jenny. Appears with permission of the author. 
The Swing,"
How do you like to go up in a swing, 
             Up in the air so blue? 
Oh, I do think it the pleasantest thing 
             Ever a child can do! 

Up in the air and over the wall, 
             Till I can see so wide, 
River and trees and cattle and all 
             Over the countryside—

Till I look down on the garden green, 
              Down on the roof so brown—
Up in the air I go flying again,

The Celestial Surgeon,"
If I have faltered more or less
In my great task of happiness;
If I have moved among my race
And shown no glorious morning face;
If beams from happy human eyes
Have moved me not; if morning skies,
Books, and my food, and summer rain
Knocked on my sullen heart in vain:-
Lord, thy most pointed pleasure take
And stab my spirit broad awake;
Or, Lord, if too obdurate I,
Choose thou, before that spirit die,
A piercing pain, a killing sin,
And to my dead heart run them in!",Robert Louis Stevenson,Poets.Org,15.0,30.53333333333333, This poem is in the public domain.

Long jetty, long shell-racked jetty, cracked warped planks.

Beautiful fish, beautiful sea-bass poached with an August tomato, on an ironstone plate.

A snake's slough, a snake's spinal cord, a dry-rot stump.

A twill tape measure, an audiotape cassette unspooled and puckered, shining.

Agate prayer beads, kazoos, whistles, rattles.

Sun, angled in low and oblique,
Backlit—with cold fever—the dull lantern.

Emptied, the dangled nest drew him:
Gray. Translucent. At times an heirloom
Of glare, paper white as burning ash.

Neither destination nor charm, the nest
Possessed a gravity, lured him, nonetheless,
And he returned to behold the useless globe

Eclipse, wane and wax. He returned,
A restless ghost in a house the wind owns,
And the wind went right through him.",Eric Pankey,Poets.Org,16.0,28.8125, From The Pear as One Example by Eric Pankey. Copyright © 2008 by Eric Pankey. Published by Ausable Press. Used by permission of the publisher. All rights reserved.

There were the walls of the mind.

Now that no one looking at the night—
Sky blanked by leakage from electric lamps
And headlights prowling through the parking lot
Could recognize the Babylonian dance

And scales, and swordsmen battling with beasts

Illegibly across an empty space,
Maybe the old unfalsifiable
Predictions and extrapolated spheres
No longer need to be an obstacle

Because I am not married, I have the skin of an orange

I am blind. I cannot tell when a hand reaches in

How I Am,"
When I talk to my friends I pretend I am standing on the wings 

of a flying plane. I cannot be trusted to tell them how I am. 
Or if I am falling to earth weighing less 

than a dozen roses. Sometimes I dream they have broken up 

with their lovers and are carrying food to my house. 
When I open the mailbox I hear their voices 

like the long upward-winding curve of a train whistle 

passing through the tall grasses and ferns 
after the train has passed. I never get ahead of their shadows. 

I embrace them in front of moving cars. I keep them away 

from my miseries because to say I am miserable is to say I am like them. ",Jason Shinder,Poets.Org,19.0,32.31578947368421," Copyright© 2005 by Jason Shinder.

My heart simplified, I think about your sex,
before the ripe daughterloin of day.
I touch the bud of joy, it is in season.

and harmonious than the belly of the Shadow,

from God himself.

Instead of hiding there.

Yet there it was content to bloom,
In modest tints arrayed;

Within the silent shade.

The forests in the grass:

They walk about a long way off; 
And, when we're at the sea,
Let father stoop as best he can
He can't find things like me.

And all the puddles freeze,

High up above the trees.",Laurence Alma-Tadema,Poets.Org,20.0,23.0, This poem is in the public domain.

"Break, Break, Break","
Break, break, break,
    On thy cold gray stones, O sea!
And I would that my tongue could utter
    The thoughts that arise in me.

O, well for the fisherman's boy,
    That he shouts with his sister at play!
O, well for the sailor lad,
    That he sings in his boat on the bay!

And the stately ships go on
    To their haven under the hill;
But O for the touch of a vanished hand,
    And the sound of a voice that is still!

Break, break, break,
    At the foot of thy crags, O sea!
But the tender grace of a day that is dead
    Will never come back to me.","Alfred, Lord Tennyson",Poets.Org,20.0,27.15, This poem is in the public domain.

Song on May Morning,"

The yellow Cowslip, and the pale Primrose.

Dear son of Memory, great heir of Fame,
What need'st thou such weak witnes of thy name?
Thou in our wonder and astonishment
Hast built thy self a live-long Monument.
For whilst to th' shame of slow-endeavouring art,
Thy easie numbers flow, and that each heart
Hath from the leaves of thy unvalu'd Book
Those Delphick lines with deep impression took,
Then thou our fancy of it self bereaving,
Dost make us Marble with too much conceaving;
And so Sepulcher'd in such pomp dost lie,
That Kings for such a Tomb would wish to die.",John Milton,Poets.Org,17.0,39.70588235294117, This poem is in the public domain.

The Golden Years,"&#13;
All I do these drawn-out days&#13;
is sit in my kitchen at Pheasant Ridge&#13;

and last time I looked, no ridge.&#13;

Poetry Is a Destructive Force,"
That's what misery is,
Nothing to have at heart. 
It is to have or nothing. 

It is a thing to have, 
A lion, an ox in his breast, 
To feel it breathing there.
 
Corazon, stout dog, 
Young ox, bow-legged bear, 
He tastes its blood, not spit. 

He is like a man 
In the body of a violent beast. 
Its muscles are his own . . .

The lion sleeps in the sun. 
Its nose is on its paws. 
It can kill a man. ",Wallace Stevens,Poets.Org,20.0,19.15," From The Collected Poems of Wallace Stevens by Wallace Stevens. Copyright © 1954 by Wallace Stevens and renewed in 1982 by Holly Stevens.

But her heart was tired, tired,

To steal a glance and, anxious, see
Him slipping into transparency—
The feathered helmet already in place,
Its shadow fallen across his face

Unsteadies the routines of the heart.

What harm, what help might he then bring?

But suddenly he disappears,
As so much else has down the years...
Until I feel him deep inside
The emptiness, preoccupied.

"Evening Concert, Sainte-Chapelle","
The celebrated windows flamed with light
directly pouring north across the Seine;
we rustled into place.  Then violins
vaunting Vivaldi's strident strength, then Brahms,
seemed to suck with their passionate sweetness,
bit by bit, the vigor from the red,
the blazing blue, so that the listening eye
saw suddenly the thick black lines, in shapes
of shield and cross and strut and brace, that held
the holy glowing fantasy together.
The music surged; the glow became a milk,
a whisper to the eye, a glimmer ebbed
until our beating hearts, our violins
were cased in thin but solid sheets of lead.

"Summer at Blue Creek, North Carolina","
There was no water at my grandfather's
when I was a kid and would go for it
with two zinc buckets. Down the path,
past the cow by the foundation where
the fine people's house was before
they arranged to have it burned down.
To the neighbor's cool well. Would
come back with pails too heavy,
so my mouth pulled out of shape.
I see myself, but from the outside.
I keep trying to feel who I was,

if the rug beneath us

Hawk,"
All eyes are fearful of the spotted hawk,
whose dappled wingspread opens to a phrase
that only victims gaping in the gaze
of Death Occurring can recite. To stalk;
to plunge; to harvest; the denial-squawk
of dying's struggle; these are but a day's 
rebuke to hunger for the hawk, whose glazed
accord with Death admits no show of shock.

Death's users know it is not theirs to own,
nor can they fathom all it means to die—
for young to know a different Death from old.
But when the spotted hawk's last flight is flown,
he too becomes a novice, fear-struck by
the certain plummet once these feathers fold.",Daniel Waters,Poets.Org,16.0,36.8125, From Skunk Night Sonnets by Daniel Waters. Copyright © 2009 by Daniel Waters. Used by permission of Bright Hill Press. All rights reserved.

But O!  the dream of the dropped stitch!  the loophole
through which that unruly within might thread,
catch with a small snag, pull the fray, unknit

hurry, every yellow spreads its perfume

of their dresses in the summer trance-
light, their bare calves already far-gone
in green.  What songs will they follow?

or harm the border promises, whatever
calm.  Let them go.  Let them go traceless

Greeter of Souls,"
Ponds are spring-fed, lakes run off rivers. 
Here souls pass, not one deified, 
and sometimes this is terrible to know 
three floors below the street, where light drinks the world, 
siphoned like music through portals. 
How fed, that dark, the octaves framed faceless. 
A memory of water. 
The trees more beautiful not themselves. 
Souls who have passed here, tired, brightening. 
Dumpsters of linen, empty 
gurneys along corridors to parking garages. 
Who wonders, is it morning? 
Who washes these blankets? 
Can I not be the greeter of souls? 
What's to be done with the envelopes of hair? 
If the inlets are frozen, can I walk across?

"As kingfishers catch fire, dragonflies draw flame","
As kingfishers catch fire, dragonflies dráw fláme;	
As tumbled over rim in roundy wells	
Stones ring; like each tucked string tells, each hung bell's	
Bow swung finds tongue to fling out broad its name;	
Each mortal thing does one thing and the same:	        
Deals out that being indoors each one dwells;	
Selves—goes itself; myself it speaks and spells,	
Crying Whát I do is me: for that I came.

Lovely in limbs, and lovely in eyes not his

To Her Father with Some Verses,"
Most truly honoured, and as truly dear, 
If worth in me or ought I do appear, 
Who can of right better demand the same 
Than may your worthy self from whom it came? 
The principal might yield a greater sum, 
Yet handled ill, amounts but to this crumb; 
My stock's so small I know not how to pay, 
My bond remains in force unto this day; 
Yet for part payment take this simple mite, 
Where nothing's to be had, kings loose their right. 
Such is my debt I may not say forgive, 
But as I can, I'll pay it while I live; 
Such is my bond, none can discharge but I, 
Yet paying is not paid until I die. ",Anne Bradstreet,Poets.Org,15.0,39.0, This poem is in the public domain.

Shoal of Sharks,"
""Oh, look at all the porpoise!"" someone shouted 
While passengers ran to snap their cameras; 
But what they leaned toward was a shoal of sharks 
Before us, moving like a floating island: 
A seething multitude of tails and fins 
Fleeing the fury of a hurricane 
Hundreds of miles away. They splashed and swarmed. 
Slashing the sea to threads of hissing foam 
Beneath us, tossing bellies to the sun. 
Staring into the blood pits of our eyes 
Ferocious for the flesh and stench of us.

Ships That Pass in the Night,"
Out in the sky the great dark clouds are massing;
   I look far out into the pregnant night,
Where I can hear a solemn booming gun
   And catch the gleaming of a random light,
That tells me that the ship I seek is passing, passing.

My tearful eyes my soul's deep hurt are glassing;
   For I would hail and check that ship of ships.
I stretch my hands imploring, cry aloud,
   My voice falls dead a foot from mine own lips,
And but its ghost doth reach that vessel, passing, passing.

O Earth, O Sky, O Ocean, both surpassing,
   O heart of mine, O soul that dreads the dark!
Is there no hope for me? Is there no way
   That I may sight and check that speeding bark

Years of regret and grief,

You are not beautiful, exactly.
You are beautiful, inexactly.
You let a weed grow by the mulberry

So close, in the personal quiet
of a windy night, it brushes the wall
and sweeps away the day till we sleep.

A child said it, and it seemed true:
""Things that are lost are all equal.""
But it isn't true. If I lost you,
the air wouldn't move, nor the tree grow.

Shells,"

On Moving Again,"
This evening, walking along the long field
My eye was drawn to a living shimmer in the sky:
Three aspens alone alive in a world of almost motionless 
Cottonwood and willow and Chinese elm trees.

The breeze that barely stirred the others
Sprang it free, spangling leaves like light on water,
An electric flutter, the secret energy
In the heart of the world revealed.  So free.

An aspen leaf might believe itself inordinately busy
(especially comparatively) and certain therefore
It will expire prematurely, useless, stupid, failed.
From where I stood, it was the most beautiful thing to see.

Ways apt and new to sing of love I'd find,
Forcing from her hard heart full many a sigh,
And re-enkindle in her frozen mind
Desires a thousand, passionate and high;

See her fond eyes at length where pity reigns,
As one who sorrows when too late, alas!
For his own error and another's pains;
See the fresh roses edging that fair snow
Move with her breath, that ivory descried,
Which turns to marble him who sees it near;

Lost,"
A cry was heard among the trees,
not a man's, something deeper.
The forest extended up one side
the mountain and down the other. 
None wanted to ask what had made
the cry. A bird, one wanted to say,
although he knew it wasn't a bird.
The sun climbed to the mountaintop,  
and slid back down the other side.
The black treetops against the sky
were like teeth on a saw. They waited
for it to come a second time. It's lost,
one said. Each thought of being lost
and all the years that stretched behind.
Where had wrong turns been made?
Soon the cry came again. Closer now. ",Stephen Dobyns,Poets.Org,17.0,32.64705882352941, From Winter's Journey by Stephen Dobyns. Copyright © 2010 by Stephen Dobyns. Used by permission of Copper Canyon Press. All rights reserved.

She stares at his players

When he tries to talk to her,
his sentences dissolve, the nouns

He knows why his players 
lift and curl. He sees them 
tightening their belts. Bodies

The Pilaster,"

Whose simple lives, complete and without flaw, 
Were part and parcel of great Nature's law;

In the delight that work alone can give.

Over ten cities shall ye reign as kings.""",Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,Poets.Org,17.0,39.23529411764706, From Morituri Salutamus: Poem for the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Class of 1825 in Bowdoin College; 1875.

Children picking through the rocks

Broken shells, tire treads, rusted aluminum pull-tabs—
downriver, near the sun, the great echoes 
and the embers of the bridge; and upriver,
far away, the echoing spools and dynamos 
of the dam, its forces crackling outward 
like the giant snow crab's jointed legs,
like a web in sunlight, a net, a chorus
of embers, like a plan the river is planning,
abstract, afire and electric, glowing

visible to children, undiscovered:

Soul-Sight,"
Like moon-dark, like brown water you escape,
O laughing mouth, O sweet uplifted lips.
Within the peering brain old ghosts take shape;
You flame and wither as the white foam slips
Back from the broken wave: sometimes a start,
A gesture of the hands, a way you own
Of bending that smooth head above your heart,—
Then these are vanished, then the dream is gone.

Oh, you are too much mine and flesh of me
To seal upon the brain, who in the blood
Are so intense a pulse, so swift a flood
Of beauty, such unceasing instancy.

(of course) he thought he had a whore. All

to watch the last blues fading on the waves.
You've lived in small houses, tight spaces—
the walls around you kept closing in—
but the sea and the sky were also yours.

Mutability,"
We are as clouds that veil the midnight moon;
  How restlessly they speed, and gleam, and quiver,
Streaking the darkness radiantly!—yet soon
  Night closes round, and they are lost for ever:

Or like forgotten lyres, whose dissonant strings
  Give various response to each varying blast,
To whose frail frame no second motion brings
  One mood or modulation like the last.

We rest.—A dream has power to poison sleep;
  We rise.—One wandering thought pollutes the day;
We feel, conceive or reason, laugh or weep;
  Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away:

It is the same!—For, be it joy or sorrow,
  The path of its departure still is free:

  Nought may endure but Mutability.",Percy Bysshe Shelley,Poets.Org,20.0,35.35, `

Dependants,"
How good we are for each other, walking through
a land of silence and darkness. You
open doors for me, I answer the phone for you.

I play jungle loud. You read with the light on.
Beautiful. The curve of your cheekbone,
explosive vowels, exact use of cologne.

What are you thinking? I ask in a language of touch
unique to us. You tap my palm nothing much.
At stations we compete senses, see which

comes first—light in the tunnel, whiplash down the rail.
I kick your shins when we go out for meals.
You dab my lips. I finger yours like Braille.",Paul Farley,Poets.Org,16.0,33.25, From The Atlantic Tunnel by Paul Farley. Copyright 2010 © by Paul Farley. Reprinted with permission of Faber and Faber.

All day it had been raining
in that field in Southern Italy

rain beating down making puddles in the mud
hissing down on rocks from a sky enraged

you stared at me without love in your large eyes
that were filled with black sex and white powder

Fear of the Future,"
In the end one simply withdraws
From others and time, one's own time,
Becoming an imaginary Everyman
Inhabiting a few rooms, personifying 
The urge to tend one's garden,
A character of no strong attachments
Who made nothing happen, and to whom
Nothing ever actually happened—a fictitious
Man whose life was over from the start,
Like a diary or a daybook whose poems
And stories told the same story over
And over again, or no story. The pictures
And paintings hang crooked on the walls, 
The limbs beneath the sheets are frail and cold
And morning is an exercise in memory
Of a long failure, and of the years
Mirrored in the face of the immaculate
Child who can't believe he's old.",John Koethe,Poets.Org,19.0,34.94736842105263, From Ninety-fifth Street. Copyright © 2009 by John Koethe. Used with permission of HarperCollins Publishers.

How many Octobers he had left to him
In increments of ten or, say, eleven

In health-care, self-help, or new-age regimens—
What with his habits and family history,
The end he thought is nearer than you think.

The Ear is an Organ Made for Love,"(for Me-K)

It was the language that left us first.
The Great Migration of words. When people
spoke they punched each other in the mouth.
There was no vocabulary for love. Women
became masculine and could no longer give
birth to warmth or a simple caress with their
lips. Tongues were overweight from profanity
and the taste of nastiness. It settled over cities
like fog smothering everything in sight. My
ears begged for camouflage and the chance
to go to war. Everywhere was the decay of
how we sound. Someone said it reminded
them of the time Sonny Rollins disappeared.
People spread stories of how the air would
never be the same or forgive. It was the end

My Heart,"
That Mississippi chicken shack.
That initial-scarred tabletop,

That kiosk at the mall selling caramels and kitsch.
That tollbooth with its white-plastic-gloved worker
handing you your change.
That phone booth with the receiver ripped out.
That dressing room in the fetish boutique,
those curtains and mirrors.
That funhouse, that horror, that soundtrack of screams.
That putti-filled heaven raining gilt from the ceiling.

Hard by the lilied Nile I saw
A duskish river-dragon stretched along,
The brown habergeon of his limbs enamelled
With sanguine almandines and rainy pearl:
And on his back there lay a young one sleeping,
No bigger than a mouse; with eyes like beads,
And a small fragment of its speckled egg
Remaining on its harmless, pulpy snout;
A thing to laugh at, as it gaped to catch
The baulking merry flies. In the iron jaws
Of the great devil-beast, like a pale soul
Fluttering in rocky hell, lightsomely flew
A snowy trochilus, with roseate beak
Tearing the hairy leeches from his throat.",Thomas Lovell Beddoes,Poets.Org,15.0,37.86666666666667, This poem is in the public domain.

Past Thymiaterion, in calméd bays,
Between the Southern and the western Horn,
Heard neither warbling of the nightingale,
Nor melody of the Lybian lotus flute
Blown seaward from the shore; but from a slope
That ran bloom-bright into the Atlantic blue,
Beneath a highland leaning down a weight
Of cliffs, and zoned below with cedar shade,
Came voices, like the voices in a dream,
Continuous, till he reached the other sea.","Alfred, Lord Tennyson",Poets.Org,15.0,39.73333333333333, This poem is in the public domain. 
Song from Paracelsus,"
Heap cassia, sandal-buds and stripes
Of labdanum, and aloe-balls,
Smeared with dull nard an Indian wipes
From out her hair: such balsam falls
Down sea-side mountain pedestals,
From tree-tops where tired winds are fain,
Spent with the vast and howling main,
To treasure half their island-gain.

And strew faint sweetness from some old
Egyptian's fine worm-eaten shroud
Which breaks to dust when once unrolled;
Or shredded perfume, like a cloud
From closet long to quiet vowed,
With mothed and dropping arras hung,
Mouldering her lute and books among,
As when a queen, long dead, was young.",Robert Browning,Poets.Org,18.0,31.83333333333333, This poem is in the public domain.

The House,"
Sometimes, on waking, she would close her eyes
For a last look at that white house she knew
In sleep alone, and held no title to,
And had not entered yet, for all her sighs.

What did she tell me of that house of hers?
White gatepost; terrace; fanlight of the door;
A widow's walk above the bouldered shore;
Salt winds that ruffle the surrounding firs.

Is she now there, wherever there may be?
Only a foolish man would hope to find
That haven fashioned by her dreaming mind.

My First Roses,"
My first roses brought me to my senses.
All my furies, I launched them like paper boats

First they were pale, then peach and blood red.
You could be merciless trimming them back.
You could be merciless and I needed that.

Emerald green with crimson tips,
these were no crowns of thorns.
They would not portend nor intimate.

two generations in a single summer.

Slowly, without sun, the day sinks
toward the close of December.
It is minus sixty degrees.

Over the sleeping houses a dense
fog rises—smoke from banked fires,
and the snowy breath of an abyss
through which the cold town
is perceptibly falling.

As if Death were a voice made visible, 
with the power of illumination...

Now, in the white shadow
of those streets, ghostly newsboys
make their rounds, delivering 
to the homes of those
who have died of the frost

I always thought death would be like traveling
in a car, moving through the desert,
the earth a little darker than sky at the horizon,

quiet in the car, moving through the night,

South,"
In the small towns along the river
nothing happens day after long day.
Summer weeks stalled forever,
and long marriages always the same.
Lives with only emergencies, births,
and fishing for excitement. Then a ship
comes out of the mist. Or comes around
the bend carefully one morning
in the rain, past the pines and shrubs.
Arrives on a hot fragrant night,
grandly, all lit up. Gone two days
later, leaving fury in its wake.

After Us,"
One day someone will fold our blankets
and send them to the cleaners
to scrub the last grain of salt from them,
will open our letters and sort them out by date
instead of by how often they've been read.

One day someone will rearrange the room's furniture
like chessmen at the start of a new game,
will open the old shoebox 
where we hoard pyjama-buttons,
not-quite-dead batteries and hunger.

One day the ache will return to our backs
from the weight of hotel room keys
and the receptionist's suspicion

Egg,"
When you kill it at the edge of the pan, you don't notice
That the egg grows an eye in death.

It is so small, it doesn't satisfy
Even the most modest morning appetite.

But it already watches, already stares at your world.
What are its horizons, whose glassy-eyed perspectives?

Does it see time, which moves carelessly through space?
Eyeballs, eyeballs, cracked shells, chaos or order?

Big questions for such a little eye at such an early hour.  
And you – do you really want an answer?

When you sit down, eye to eye, behind a table,
You blind it soon enough with a crust of bread.

The mammoth plastic Santa lighting up
On the Quik-Stop's roof, presiding over pumps

Out back, with pumps of their own, the muttering diesels.
And we, for the most part ordinary folks,
Took all for granted: the idling semis' smoke,
The fuel that streamed into our tanks, above all

Our livelihoods. We stepped indoors to talk

Then earth in earth had of earth its fill.

My Galley Charged with Forgetfulness,"
My galley charged with forgetfulness
   Thorough sharp seas in winter nights doth pass
'Tween rock and rock; and eke mine enemy, alas,
That is my lord, steereth with cruelness;
And every oar a thought in readiness,
As though that death were light in such a case.

Of forced sighs, and trusty fearfulness
A rain of tears, a cloud of dark disdain,
Hath done the wearied cords great hinderance;
Wreathed with error and eke with ignorance,
The stars be hid that led me to this pain;
Drowned is reason that should me consort,
And I remain despairing of the port.",Thomas Wyatt,Poets.Org,15.0,39.0, This poem is in the public domain.
